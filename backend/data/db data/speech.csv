216,Petunia Dursley,a freak!
217,Petunia Dursley,and then she met that potter and then she had you and i knew you'd be just the same just as strange just as ... abnormal.
218,Petunia Dursley,and then if you please she went and got herself blown up.
219,Petunia Dursley,and we got landed with you.
220,Harry Potter,blown up?

234,Rubeus Hagrid,never insult albus dumbledore in front of me.
235,Dudley Dursley,ahh!
236,Rubeus Hagrid,oh um i'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at hogwarts about that.

326,Harry Potter,hello?
327,Harry Potter,hello?
328,Garrick Ollivander,i wondered when i'd be seeing you mr. potter.

331,Garrick Ollivander,here we are.
332,Garrick Ollivander,well give it a wave.

335,Garrick Ollivander,no no definitely not!
336,Garrick Ollivander,no matter...  i wonder.
337,Garrick Ollivander,curious very curious.
338,Harry Potter,sorry but what's curious?
339,Garrick Ollivander,i remember every wand i've ever sold mr. potter.
340,Garrick Ollivander,it just so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather just one.
341,Garrick Ollivander,it is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar.
342,Harry Potter,and...who owned that wand?
343,Garrick Ollivander,oh we do not speak his name.
344,Garrick Ollivander,the wand chooses the wizard mr. potter.
345,Garrick Ollivander,it's not always clear why but i think it is clear that we can expect great things from you.
346,Garrick Ollivander,after all he-who-must-not-be-named did great things...terrible yes but great.
347,Rubeus Hagrid,harry!
348,Rubeus Hagrid,harry!

354,Harry Potter,the one who gave me this.
355,Harry Potter,you know hagrid i know you do.
356,Rubeus Hagrid,first and understand this harry 'cause it's very important.
357,Rubeus Hagrid,not all wizards are good.
358,Rubeus Hagrid,some of them go bad.
359,Rubeus Hagrid,a few years ago there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go.
360,Rubeus Hagrid,and his name was v-...his name was v-...
361,Harry Potter,maybe if you wrote it down?
362,Rubeus Hagrid,no i can't spell it.
363,Rubeus Hagrid,all right.
364,Rubeus Hagrid,voldemort.
365,Harry Potter,voldemort?
366,Rubeus Hagrid,shh!
368,Rubeus Hagrid,it was dark times harry dark times.
369,Rubeus Hagrid,voldemort started to gather some followers brought 'em over to the dark side.
370,Rubeus Hagrid,anyone that stood up to him ended up dead.
371,Rubeus Hagrid,your parents fought against him but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em.
372,Rubeus Hagrid,nobody...not one.
373,Rubeus Hagrid,‘cept you.
374,Harry Potter,me?
375,Harry Potter,voldemort tried to kill...me?
376,Rubeus Hagrid,yes.
377,Rubeus Hagrid,that ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead harry.
378,Rubeus Hagrid,a mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that.
379,Harry Potter,what happened to...to you-know-who?
380,Rubeus Hagrid,well some say he died.
381,Rubeus Hagrid,codswallop in my opinion.
382,Rubeus Hagrid,nope i reckon he's out there still too tired to go on.

384,Rubeus Hagrid,something about you stumped him that night.
385,Rubeus Hagrid,that's why you're famous.

628,Percy Weasley,gather 'round here.
629,Percy Weasley,welcome to the gryffindor common room.
630,Percy Weasley,boy's dormitories upstairs and down to your left.
631,Percy Weasley,girls the same on your right.
632,Percy Weasley,you'll find that your belongings have already been brought up.
633,Ron Weasley,whew we made it.
634,Ron Weasley,can you imagine the look on mcgonagall's face if we were late?
635,Ron Weasley,that was bloody brilliant.
636,Minerva McGonagall,thank you for that assessment mr. weasley.
637,Minerva McGonagall,perhaps if i were to transfigure mr. potter and yourself into a pocketwatch that way one of you might be on time.
638,Harry Potter,we got lost.
639,Minerva McGonagall,then perhaps a map?
640,Minerva McGonagall,i trust you don't need one to find your seats.
641,Severus Snape,there will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class.
642,Severus Snape,as such i don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making.
643,Severus Snape,however for those select few...  who possess the predisposition i can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses.
644,Severus Snape,i can tell you how to bottle fame brew glory and even put a stopper...  in death.
645,Severus Snape,then again maybe some of you have come to hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.
646,Severus Snape,mr. potter.
647,Severus Snape,our...new...celebrity.
648,Severus Snape,tell me what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?
649,Severus Snape,you don't know?
650,Severus Snape,well let's try again.
651,Severus Snape,where mr. potter would you look if i asked you to find me a bezoar?
652,Harry Potter,i don't know sir.
653,Severus Snape,and what is the difference between monkshood and wolfbane?
654,Harry Potter,i don't know sir.
655,Severus Snape,pity.
656,Severus Snape,clearly fame isn't everything...  is it mr. potter?
657,Harry Potter,clearly hermione knows.
658,Harry Potter,since it's a pity not to ask her.
659,Severus Snape,silence.
660,Severus Snape,and put her hand down you silly girl.
661,Severus Snape,for your information potter... asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living death.
662,Severus Snape,a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons.
663,Severus Snape,as for monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of aconite.
664,Severus Snape,well?
665,Severus Snape,why aren't you all copying this down?
666,Severus Snape,and gryffindors note that five points will be taken from your house... for your classmate's cheek.
667,Seamus Finnigan,eye of rabbit harp string hum.
668,Seamus Finnigan,turn this water into rum.
669,Seamus Finnigan,eye of rabbit harp string hum...
670,Harry Potter,what's seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
671,Ron Weasley,turn it into rum.
672,Ron Weasley,actually managed a weak tea yesterday before-
673,Ron Weasley,ah.
674,Ron Weasley,mail's here!
675,Harry Potter,can i borrow this?
676,Harry Potter,thanks.
677,Seamus Finnigan,hey look!
678,Seamus Finnigan,neville's got a remembrall!
679,Hermione Granger,i've read about those.
680,Hermione Granger,when the smoke turns red  it means you've forgotten something.
681,Neville Longbottom,the only problem is i can't remember what i've forgotten.
682,Harry Potter,hey ron somebody broke into gringotts listen.
683,Harry Potter,believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown gringotts goblins while acknowledging the breach insist that nothing was taken.
684,Harry Potter,the vault in question number 713 had in fact been emptied earlier that same day.
685,Harry Potter,that's odd.
686,Harry Potter,that's the vault hagrid and i went to.

746,Rolanda Hooch,if i see a single broom in the air the one riding it will find themselves out of hogwarts before they can say quidditch.
747,Draco Malfoy,did you see his face?
748,Draco Malfoy,maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse.
749,Harry Potter,give it here malfoy.
750,Draco Malfoy,no.
751,Draco Malfoy,i think i'll leave it somewhere for longbottom to find.

778,Nearly Headless Nick,i always knew he'd do well.
779,Ron Weasley,seeker?
780,Ron Weasley,but first years never make their house teams!

783,Fred Weasley,hey well done harry wood's just told us!
784,Ron Weasley,fred and george are on the team too.
785,Ron Weasley,beaters.

787,George Weasley,can't make any promises of course.
788,George Weasley,rough game quidditch.
789,Fred Weasley,brutal.
790,Fred Weasley,but no one's died in years.
791,Fred Weasley,someone will vanish occasionally...

793,Ron Weasley,oh go on harry quidditch is great.
794,Ron Weasley,best game there is!
795,Ron Weasley,and you'll be great too!
796,Harry Potter,but i've never even played quidditch.
797,Harry Potter,what if i make a fool of myself?
798,Hermione Granger,you won't make a fool of yourself.
799,Hermione Granger,it's in your blood.
800,Ron Weasley,whoa.
801,Ron Weasley,harry you never told me your father was a seeker too.
802,Harry Potter,i-i didn't know.
803,Ron Weasley,i'm telling you it's spooky.
804,Ron Weasley,she knows more about you than you do.
805,Harry Potter,who doesn't?
806,Ron Weasley,ahh!
807,Harry Potter,what's happening?
808,Hermione Granger,the staircases change remember?
809,Harry Potter,let's go this way.
810,Ron Weasley,before the staircase moves again.
811,Harry Potter,does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?
812,Hermione Granger,we're not supposed to be here.
813,Hermione Granger,this is the 3rd floor.
814,Hermione Granger,it's forbidden.
815,Harry Potter,let's go.
816,Ron Weasley,it's filch's cat!
817,Harry Potter,run!
818,Harry Potter,quick!
819,Harry Potter,let’s hide though that door!
820,Harry Potter,it's locked!
821,Ron Weasley,that's it we're done for!
822,Hermione Granger,oh move over!
823,Hermione Granger,alohomora.
824,Hermione Granger,get in.
825,Ron Weasley,alohomora?
826,Hermione Granger,standard book of spells chapter 7.
827,Argus Filch,anyone here my sweet?
828,Argus Filch,come on.
829,Hermione Granger,filch is gone.
830,Ron Weasley,probably thinks this door's locked.
831,Hermione Granger,it was locked.
832,Harry Potter,and for good reason.
833,All,ahhhhhhh!
834,Ron Weasley,what do they think they're doing??
835,Ron Weasley,keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.
836,Hermione Granger,you don't use your eyes do you?
837,Hermione Granger,didn't you see what it was standing on?
838,Ron Weasley,i wasn't looking at its feet!
839,Ron Weasley,i was a bit preoccupied with its heads.
840,Ron Weasley,or maybe you didn't notice there were three!
841,Hermione Granger,it was standing on a trap door.
842,Hermione Granger,which means it wasn't there by accident.
843,Hermione Granger,it's guarding something.
844,Harry Potter,guarding something?
845,Hermione Granger,that's right.
846,Hermione Granger,now if you two don't mind i'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed... or worse expelled!
847,Ron Weasley,she needs to sort out her priorities!
848,Oliver Wood,quidditch is easy enough to understand.
849,Oliver Wood,each time has seven players 3 chasers 2 beaters 1 keeper and a seeker.
850,Oliver Wood,that's you.
851,Oliver Wood,there are three kinds of balls.
852,Oliver Wood,this one's called the quaffle.
853,Oliver Wood,now the chasers handle the quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops.
854,Oliver Wood,the keeper that's me defends the hoops.
855,Oliver Wood,with me so far?
856,Harry Potter,i think so.
857,Harry Potter,what are those?
858,Oliver Wood,you better take this.
859,Oliver Wood,careful now it's comin' back.
860,Oliver Wood,eh not bad potter you'd make a fair beater... uh-oh.
861,Harry Potter,what is that?
862,Oliver Wood,bludger.
863,Oliver Wood,nasty little buggers.
864,Oliver Wood,but you are the seeker and the only thing i want you to worry about is this... the golden snitch.
865,Harry Potter,i like this ball.
866,Oliver Wood,ah you like it now.
867,Oliver Wood,just wait.
868,Oliver Wood,it's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.

924,Ron Weasley,trolls are really stupid.
925,Ron Weasley,probably people playing jokes.
926,Ron Weasley,what?
927,Harry Potter,hermione!
928,Harry Potter,she doesn't know!
929,Ron Weasley,i think the troll's left the dungeon!

951,Harry Potter,ew.
952,Harry Potter,troll bogies.
953,Minerva McGonagall,oh!
954,Minerva McGonagall,oh my goodness!
955,Minerva McGonagall,e-explain yourselves both of you!
956,Ron Weasley,well what it is...
957,Harry Potter,well what it is...
958,Hermione Granger,it's my fault professor mcgonagall.
959,Minerva McGonagall,miss granger?
960,Hermione Granger,i went looking for the troll.
961,Hermione Granger,i'd read about them and thought i could handle it.
962,Hermione Granger,but i was wrong.
963,Hermione Granger,if harry and ron hadn't come and found me...i'd probably be dead.
964,Minerva McGonagall,be that as it may be...it was an extremely foolish thing to do.
965,Minerva McGonagall,i would have expected more rational behavior on your part miss granger.
966,Minerva McGonagall,five points will be taken from gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment.
967,Minerva McGonagall,as for you two gentlemen i just hope you realize how fortunate you are.
968,Minerva McGonagall,not many students could take on a fully grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale.
969,Minerva McGonagall,five points...will be awarded to each of you.
970,Minerva McGonagall,for sheer dumb luck.
971,Quirinus Quirrell,perhaps you ought to go...m-might wake up...heh.
972,Quirinus Quirrell,ahh!
973,Quirinus Quirrell,hehe....
974,Harry Potter,good for you to get us out of trouble like that.
975,Ron Weasley,mind you i mean we did save her life.
976,Harry Potter,mind you she didn't need saving if you hadn't insulted her.
977,Ron Weasley,what are friends for?
978,Ron Weasley,take a bit of toast mate go on.
979,Hermione Granger,ron's right harry.
980,Hermione Granger,you're gonna need your strength today.
981,Harry Potter,i'm not hungry.
982,Severus Snape,good luck today potter.
983,Severus Snape,then again now that you've proven yourself against a troll a little game of quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against slytherin.
984,Harry Potter,that explains the blood.
985,Hermione Granger,blood?
986,Harry Potter,listen last night i'm guessing snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog.
987,Harry Potter,but he got himself bitten that's why he's limping.
988,Hermione Granger,but why would anyone go near that dog?
989,Harry Potter,the day i was at gringotts hagrid took something out of one of the vaults.
990,Harry Potter,he said it was hogwarts' business very secret.
991,Hermione Granger,so you're saying...
992,Harry Potter,that's what the dog's guarding.
993,Harry Potter,that's what snape wants.
994,Hermione Granger,bit early for mail isn't it?
995,Harry Potter,but i-i never get mail.
996,Ron Weasley,let's open it.
997,Harry Potter,it's a broomstick!

1004,Oliver Wood,i felt the same way before my first game.
1005,Harry Potter,what happened?
1006,Oliver Wood,er i don't really remember.
1007,Oliver Wood,i took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in.

1081,Hermione Granger,you've got to keep eye contact and snape wasn't blinking.
1082,Harry Potter,exactly.
1083,Rubeus Hagrid,now you listen to me all three of you.
1084,Rubeus Hagrid,you're meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in.
1085,Rubeus Hagrid,it's dangerous.
1086,Rubeus Hagrid,what that dog is guarding is strictly between dumbledore and nicholas flamel.
1087,Harry Potter,nicholas flamel?
1088,Rubeus Hagrid,i shouldn't said that.

1191,Albus Dumbledore,i see that you like so many before you have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised.
1192,Albus Dumbledore,i trust by now you realize what it does.
1193,Albus Dumbledore,let me give you a clue.
1194,Albus Dumbledore,the happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself exactly as he is.
1195,Harry Potter,so then it shows us what we want?
1196,Harry Potter,whatever we want?
1197,Albus Dumbledore,yes...and no.
1198,Albus Dumbledore,it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desires of our hearts.
1199,Albus Dumbledore,now you who have never known your family you see them standing beside you.
1200,Albus Dumbledore,but remember this harry.
1201,Albus Dumbledore,this mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth.
1202,Albus Dumbledore,men have wasted away in front of it even gone mad.
1203,Albus Dumbledore,that is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home and i must ask you not to go looking for it again.
1204,Albus Dumbledore,it does not do to dwell on dreams harry and forget to live.
1205,Harry Potter,hi hedwig.
1206,Hermione Granger,look at you playing with your cards.
1207,Hermione Granger,pathetic!

1212,Ron Weasley,...i forgot.
1213,Hermione Granger,and what may i ask do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?
1214,Ron Weasley,copy off you?
1215,Hermione Granger,no you won't!
1216,Hermione Granger,besides according to professor mcgonagall we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell.
1217,Ron Weasley,that's insulting!
1218,Ron Weasley,it's as if they don't trust us!
1219,Ron Weasley,dumbledore again!
1220,Ron Weasley,leg-locker curse?
1221,Harry Potter,malfoy.

1232,Ron Weasley,'-for his discovery of the 12 uses of dragon blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel!'
1233,Harry Potter,i knew the name sounded familiar.
1234,Harry Potter,i read it on the train that day.
1235,Hermione Granger,follow me!
1236,Neville Longbottom,hey wait where are you going?
1237,Neville Longbottom,what about the counter-curse?
1239,Hermione Granger,i had you looking in the wrong section!
1240,Hermione Granger,how could i be so stupid?
1241,Hermione Granger,i checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.

1250,Hermione Granger,"it will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal."""
1251,Ron Weasley,immortal?

1254,Harry Potter,shh!
1255,Hermione Granger,"""the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr. nicholas flamel the noted alchemist who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"""
1256,Hermione Granger,that's what fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor.
1257,Hermione Granger,that's what's under the trapdoor...the philosopher's stone!
1258,Harry Potter,hagrid!
1259,Rubeus Hagrid,oh hello.

1266,Rubeus Hagrid,snape?
1267,Rubeus Hagrid,blimey harry you're not still on about him are you?
1268,Harry Potter,hagrid we know he's after the stone.
1269,Harry Potter,we just don't know why.
1270,Rubeus Hagrid,snape is one of the teachers protecting the stone!
1271,Rubeus Hagrid,he's not about to steal it!
1272,Harry Potter,what?
1273,Rubeus Hagrid,you heard.
1274,Rubeus Hagrid,right.

1278,Hermione Granger,of course!
1279,Hermione Granger,there are other things defending the stone aren't there?
1280,Hermione Granger,spells enchantments.
1281,Rubeus Hagrid,that's right.

1283,Rubeus Hagrid,ain't no one gonna get past fluffy.
1284,Rubeus Hagrid,hehe not a soul knows how.
1285,Rubeus Hagrid,except for me and dumbledore.
1286,Rubeus Hagrid,i shouldn't have told you that.
1287,Rubeus Hagrid,i shouldn't have told you that.

1300,Rubeus Hagrid,seemed quite glad to be rid off it as a matter of fact.
1301,Hermione Granger,is that...a dragon?
1302,Ron Weasley,that's not just a dragon.
1303,Ron Weasley,that's a norwegian ridgeback!
1304,Ron Weasley,my brother charlie works with these in romania.
1305,Rubeus Hagrid,isn't he beautiful?
1306,Rubeus Hagrid,oh.
1307,Rubeus Hagrid,bless him look.
1308,Rubeus Hagrid,he knows his mummy.
1309,Rubeus Hagrid,hehe.
1310,Rubeus Hagrid,hallo norbert.
1311,Harry Potter,norbert?
1312,Rubeus Hagrid,yeah well he's got to have a name doesn't he?
1313,Rubeus Hagrid,don't you norbert?
1314,Rubeus Hagrid,dededede.
1315,Rubeus Hagrid,ohh!
1316,Rubeus Hagrid,oooh ooh ooh well...he'll have to be trained up a bit of course.
1317,Rubeus Hagrid,who's that?
1318,Harry Potter,malfoy.
1319,Rubeus Hagrid,oh dear.
1320,Harry Potter,hagrid always wanted a dragon.
1321,Harry Potter,he told me so the first time i met him.
1322,Ron Weasley,it's crazy.
1323,Ron Weasley,and worse malfoy knows.
1324,Harry Potter,i don't understand.
1325,Harry Potter,is that bad?
1326,Ron Weasley,it's bad.
1327,Minerva McGonagall,good evening.
1328,Minerva McGonagall,nothing i repeat nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night.
1329,Minerva McGonagall,therefore as punishment for your actions 50 points will be taken.
1330,Harry Potter,50?
1332,Minerva McGonagall,each.
1333,Minerva McGonagall,and to ensure it doesn't happen again all four of you will receive detention.
1334,Draco Malfoy,excuse me professor.
1335,Draco Malfoy,perhaps i heard you wrong.
1336,Draco Malfoy,"i thought you said...""the four of us."""
1337,Minerva McGonagall,no you heard me correctly mr. malfoy.
1338,Minerva McGonagall,you see as honorable as your intentions were you too were out of bed after hours.
1339,Minerva McGonagall,you will serve detention with your classmates.
1340,Argus Filch,a pity they let the old punishments die.
1341,Argus Filch,there was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.
1342,Argus Filch,god i miss the screaming.
1343,Argus Filch,you'll be serving detention with hagrid tonight.
1344,Argus Filch,he's got a little job to do inside the dark forest.
1345,Argus Filch,a sorry lot this hagrid.
1346,Argus Filch,oh good god man you're not still on about that bloody dragon are you?
1347,Rubeus Hagrid,norbert's gone.
1348,Rubeus Hagrid,dumbledore sent him off to romania to live in a colony.
1349,Hermione Granger,well that's good isn't it?
1350,Hermione Granger,he'll be with his own kind.
1351,Rubeus Hagrid,yeah but what if he don't like romania?
1352,Rubeus Hagrid,what if the other dragons are mean to him?
1353,Rubeus Hagrid,he's only a baby after all.
1354,Argus Filch,oh for gods sake pull yourself together man.
1355,Argus Filch,you're going into the forest after all.
1356,Argus Filch,got to have your wits about you.
1357,Draco Malfoy,the forest?
1358,Draco Malfoy,i thought that was a joke!
1359,Draco Malfoy,we can't go in there.
1360,Draco Malfoy,students aren't allowed.
1361,Draco Malfoy,and there are......werewolves!
1362,Argus Filch,there's more than werewolves in those trees lad.
1363,Argus Filch,you can be sure of that.
1364,Argus Filch,nighty-night.
1365,Rubeus Hagrid,right.
1366,Rubeus Hagrid,let's go.
1367,Harry Potter,hagrid what's that?
1368,Rubeus Hagrid,what we're here for.
1369,Rubeus Hagrid,see that?
1370,Rubeus Hagrid,that's unicorn's blood that is.
1371,Rubeus Hagrid,i found one dead a few weeks ago.
1372,Rubeus Hagrid,now this one's been injured bad by something.
1373,Rubeus Hagrid,so it's our job to find the poor beast.
1374,Rubeus Hagrid,ron hermione you'll come with me.
1375,Ron Weasley,okay.
1376,Rubeus Hagrid,and harry you'll go with malfoy.
1377,Draco Malfoy,okay.
1378,Draco Malfoy,then i get fang!
1379,Rubeus Hagrid,fine.
1380,Rubeus Hagrid,just so you know he's a bloody coward.
1381,Draco Malfoy,you wait till my father hears about this.
1382,Draco Malfoy,this is servant's stuff.
1383,Harry Potter,if i didn't know better draco i'd say you were scared.
1384,Draco Malfoy,scared potter?!
1385,Draco Malfoy,did you hear that?
1386,Draco Malfoy,come on fang.
1387,Draco Malfoy,scared.
1388,Harry Potter,what is it fang?
1389,Draco Malfoy,help!!!!
1391,Firenze,harry potter you must leave.
1392,Firenze,you are known to many creatures here.
1393,Firenze,the forest is not safe at this time.
1394,Firenze,especially for you.
1395,Harry Potter,but what was that thing you saved me from?
1396,Firenze,a monstrous creature.
1397,Firenze,it is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.
1398,Firenze,drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death.
1399,Firenze,but at a terrible price.
1400,Firenze,you have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips you will have a half-life.
1401,Firenze,a cursed life.
1402,Harry Potter,but who would choose such a life?
1403,Firenze,can you think of no one?
1404,Harry Potter,do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was voldemort?
1405,Firenze,do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
1406,Harry Potter,the philosopher's stone.
1407,Hermione Granger,harry!
1408,Rubeus Hagrid,hello there firenze.
1409,Rubeus Hagrid,i see you've met our young mr. potter.
1410,Rubeus Hagrid,you all right there harry?
1411,Firenze,harry potter this is where i leave you.
1412,Firenze,you're safe now.
1413,Firenze,good luck.
1414,Hermione Granger,you mean you-know-who's out there right now in the forest?
1415,Harry Potter,but he's weak.
1416,Harry Potter,he's living off the unicorns.
1417,Harry Potter,don't you see?
1418,Harry Potter,we had it wrong!
1419,Harry Potter,snape doesn't want the stone for himself; he wants the stone for voldemort.
1420,Harry Potter,with the elixir of life voldemort will be strong again.
1421,Harry Potter,he'll... he'll come back.
1422,Ron Weasley,but if he comes back you don't think he'll try to... kill you do you?
1423,Harry Potter,i think if he'd had the chance he might've tried to kill me tonight.
1424,Ron Weasley,and to think i've been worrying about my potions final.
1425,Hermione Granger,hang on a minute.
1426,Hermione Granger,we're forgetting one thing.
1427,Hermione Granger,who's the one wizard voldemort always feared?
1428,Hermione Granger,dumbledore.
1429,Hermione Granger,as long as dumbledore's around harry you're safe.
1430,Hermione Granger,as long as dumbledore's around you can't be touched.
1431,Hermione Granger,i've always heard hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful but i found that rather enjoyable.
1432,Ron Weasley,speak for yourself.
1433,Ron Weasley,all right there harry?
1434,Harry Potter,my scar.
1435,Harry Potter,it keeps burning.
1436,Hermione Granger,it's happened before.
1437,Harry Potter,not like this.
1438,Ron Weasley,perhaps you should see the nurse.
1439,Harry Potter,i think it's a warning.
1440,Harry Potter,it means dangers coming.
1441,Harry Potter,uhh!
1442,Harry Potter,oh.
1443,Harry Potter,of course!
1444,Hermione Granger,what is it?
1445,Harry Potter,don't you think it's a bit odd that what hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?
1446,Harry Potter,i mean how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets?
1447,Harry Potter,why didn't i see it before?
1448,Harry Potter,hagrid who gave you the dragon egg?
1449,Harry Potter,what did he look like?
1450,Rubeus Hagrid,i don't know.
1451,Rubeus Hagrid,i never saw his face.
1452,Rubeus Hagrid,he kept his hood up.
1453,Harry Potter,the stranger though you and he must have talked.
1454,Rubeus Hagrid,well he wanted to know what sort of creatures i looked after.
1455,Rubeus Hagrid,i told him.
1456,Rubeus Hagrid,"i said ""after fluffy a dragon's gonna be no problem."""
1457,Harry Potter,and did he seem interested in fluffy?
1458,Rubeus Hagrid,well of course he was interested in fluffy!
1459,Rubeus Hagrid,how often do you come across a three headed dog even if you're in the trade?
1460,Rubeus Hagrid,but i told him.
1461,Rubeus Hagrid,"i said ""the trick with any beast is to know how to calm him."
1462,Rubeus Hagrid,"take fluffy for example just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep."""
1463,Rubeus Hagrid,i shouldn't have told you that.
1464,Rubeus Hagrid,where you going?!
1465,Rubeus Hagrid,wait!
1466,Harry Potter,we have to see professor dumbledore immediately!
1467,Minerva McGonagall,i'm afraid professor dumbledore is not here.
1468,Minerva McGonagall,he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and left immediately for london.
1469,Harry Potter,he's gone?!
1470,Harry Potter,now?
1471,Harry Potter,but this is important!
1472,Harry Potter,it's about...the philosopher's stone.
1473,Minerva McGonagall,how do you know ?
1474,Harry Potter,someone's going to try and steal it.
1475,Minerva McGonagall,i don't know how you three found out about the stone but i can assure you it is perfectly well-protected.
1476,Minerva McGonagall,now would you go back to your dormitories?
1477,Minerva McGonagall,quietly.
1478,Harry Potter,that was no stranger hagrid met in the village.
1479,Harry Potter,it was snape which means he knows how to get past fluffy.
1480,Hermione Granger,and with dumbledore gone
1481,Severus Snape,good afternoon.
1482,Severus Snape,now what would three young gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?
1483,Hermione Granger,uh...we were just...
1484,Severus Snape,you want to be careful.
1485,Severus Snape,people will think you're  up to something.
1486,Hermione Granger,now what do we do?
1487,Harry Potter,we go down the trapdoor.
1488,Harry Potter,tonight.
1489,Harry Potter,trevor.
1490,Ron Weasley,trevor shh!
1491,Ron Weasley,go you shouldn't be here!
1492,Neville Longbottom,neither should you.
1493,Neville Longbottom,you're sneaking out again arent you?
1494,Harry Potter,now neville listen.
1495,Harry Potter,we were
1496,Neville Longbottom,no!
1497,Neville Longbottom,i won't let you!
1498,Neville Longbottom,you'll get gryffindor in trouble again!
1499,Neville Longbottom,i-i'll fight you.
1500,Hermione Granger,neville i'm really really sorry about this... petrificus totalus.
1501,Ron Weasley,you're a little scary sometimes...you know that?
1502,Ron Weasley,brilliant but scary.
1503,Harry Potter,let's go.
1504,Harry Potter,sorry.
1505,Hermione Granger,sorry.
1506,Ron Weasley,it's for your own good you know.
1507,Hermione Granger,ow!
1508,Hermione Granger,you stood on my foot!
1509,Ron Weasley,sorry.
1510,Hermione Granger,alohomora.
1511,Ron Weasley,wait a minute...he's.... sleeping.
1512,Harry Potter,snape's already been here.
1513,Harry Potter,he's put a spell on the harp.
1514,Ron Weasley,uh.
1515,Ron Weasley,it's got horrible breath!
1516,Harry Potter,we have to move its paw.
1517,Ron Weasley,what?
1519,Harry Potter,come on!
1520,Harry Potter,okay.
1521,Harry Potter,push!
1522,Harry Potter,i'll go first.
1523,Harry Potter,don't follow until i give you a sign.
1524,Harry Potter,if something bad happens get yourselves out...does it seem a bit...quiet?
1525,Hermione Granger,the harp.
1526,Hermione Granger,it stopped playing.
1527,Ron Weasley,ew!
1528,Ron Weasley,yuck!
1529,Ron Weasley,ugh.

1539,Hermione Granger,this is devil's snare.
1540,Hermione Granger,you have to relax.

1560,Harry Potter,yeah yeah i'm fine.
1561,Ron Weasley,help!
1562,Hermione Granger,he's not relaxing is he?
1563,Harry Potter,apparently not.
1564,Ron Weasley,help!
1565,Ron Weasley,help me!
1566,Hermione Granger,we've got to do something!
1567,Harry Potter,what?
1568,Hermione Granger,uh!
1569,Hermione Granger,i remember reading something in herbology.

1578,Harry Potter,okay.
1579,Ron Weasley,whew.
1580,Ron Weasley,lucky we didn't panic!
1581,Harry Potter,lucky hermione pays attention in herbology.
1582,Hermione Granger,what is that?
1583,Harry Potter,i don't know.
1584,Harry Potter,sounds like wings.
1585,Hermione Granger,curious.
1586,Hermione Granger,i've never seen birds like these.
1587,Harry Potter,they're not birds they're keys.
1588,Harry Potter,and i'll bet one of them fits that door.
1589,Hermione Granger,what's this all about?
1590,Harry Potter,i don't know.
1591,Harry Potter,strange.
1592,Ron Weasley,alohomora!
1593,Ron Weasley,well it was worth a try.
1594,Hermione Granger,ugh!
1595,Hermione Granger,what're we going to do?
1596,Hermione Granger,there must be 1000 keys up there!
1597,Ron Weasley,we're looking for a big old fashioned one.
1598,Ron Weasley,probably rusty like the handle.
1599,Harry Potter,there!
1600,Harry Potter,i see it!
1601,Harry Potter,the one with the broken wing!
1602,Hermione Granger,what's wrong harry?
1603,Harry Potter,it's too simple.
1604,Ron Weasley,oh go on harry!
1605,Ron Weasley,if snape can catch it on that old broomstick you can!
1606,Ron Weasley,you're the youngest seeker in a century!
1607,Ron Weasley,this complicates things a bit!
1608,Harry Potter,catch the key!
1609,Ron Weasley,hurry up!
1610,Hermione Granger,i don't like this.
1611,Hermione Granger,i don't like this at all.
1612,Harry Potter,where are we?
1613,Harry Potter,a graveyard.
1614,Ron Weasley,this is no graveyard.
1615,Ron Weasley,it's a chessboard.
1616,Harry Potter,there's the door.
1617,Hermione Granger,now what do we do?
1618,Ron Weasley,it's obvious isn't it?
1619,Ron Weasley,we've got to play our way across the room.
1620,Ron Weasley,all right.
1621,Ron Weasley,harry you take the bishop's square.
1622,Ron Weasley,hermione you'll be the queen's side castle.
1623,Ron Weasley,as for me i'll be a knight.
1624,Hermione Granger,what happens now?
1625,Ron Weasley,well white moves first and then...we play.
1626,Hermione Granger,ron you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess do you?
1627,Ron Weasley,you there!
1628,Ron Weasley,d-5!
1629,Ron Weasley,yes hermione i think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!
1630,Ron Weasley,castle to e-4!
1631,Ron Weasley,smash!
1632,Ron Weasley,ron: pawn to c-3!
1633,Ron Weasley,smash!
1634,Ron Weasley,boom!
1635,Ron Weasley,the queen turns and smashes a piece!
1636,Ron Weasley,harry ron and hermione wince.
1637,Ron Weasley,the queen turns again.
1638,Ron Weasley,both ron and harry study the game.
1639,Harry Potter,wait a minute.
1640,Ron Weasley,you understand right harry.
1641,Ron Weasley,once i make my move the queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the king.
1642,Harry Potter,no ron!
1643,Harry Potter,no!
1644,Hermione Granger,what is it?
1645,Harry Potter,he's going to sacrifice himself!
1646,Hermione Granger,no ron you can't!
1647,Hermione Granger,there must be another way!
1648,Ron Weasley,do you want to stop snape or not?
1649,Ron Weasley,harry it's you that has to go on.
1650,Ron Weasley,i know it.
1651,Ron Weasley,not me not hermione you.
1652,Ron Weasley,knight...to h-3.

1654,Ron Weasley,ahhhh!
1655,Harry Potter,ron!
1656,Harry Potter,no!
1657,Harry Potter,don't move!
1658,Harry Potter,dont forget we're still playing.
1659,Harry Potter,checkmate.
1660,Harry Potter,take care of ron.
1661,Harry Potter,then go to the owlery.
1662,Harry Potter,send a message to dumbledore.
1663,Harry Potter,ron's right...i have to go on.
1664,Hermione Granger,you'll be okay harry.
1665,Hermione Granger,you're a great wizard you really are.
1666,Harry Potter,not as good as you.
1667,Hermione Granger,me?
1668,Hermione Granger,books and cleverness?
1669,Hermione Granger,there are more important things.
1670,Hermione Granger,friendship and bravery.
1671,Hermione Granger,and harry just be careful.
1672,Harry Potter,you?
1673,Harry Potter,no.
1674,Harry Potter,i-it can’t be.
1675,Harry Potter,snape h-he was the one—-
1676,Quirinus Quirrell,yes.
1677,Quirinus Quirrell,he does seem the type doesn’t he?
1678,Quirinus Quirrell,next to him who would suspect p-p-p-poor st-stuttering professor quirrell?
1679,Harry Potter,but-but that day during the quidditch match snape tried to kill me.
1680,Quirinus Quirrell,no dear boy.
1681,Quirinus Quirrell,i tried to kill you.
1682,Quirinus Quirrell,and trust me if snape’s cloak hadn’t caught fire and broken my eye contact i would have succeeded even with snape muttering his little countercurse.
1683,Harry Potter,snape was trying to save me?
1684,Quirinus Quirrell,i knew you were a danger to me right from the off.
1685,Quirinus Quirrell,especially after halloween.
1686,Harry Potter,then-then you let the troll in.
1687,Quirinus Quirrell,very good potter yes.
1688,Quirinus Quirrell,snape unfortunately wasn’t fooled.
1689,Quirinus Quirrell,while everyone else was running about the dungeon he went to the third floor to head me off.
1690,Quirinus Quirrell,he of course never trusted me again.
1691,Quirinus Quirrell,he rarely left me alone.
1692,Quirinus Quirrell,but he doesn’t understand.
1693,Quirinus Quirrell,i’m never alone never.
1694,Quirinus Quirrell,now what does this mirror do?
1695,Quirinus Quirrell,i see what i desire.
1696,Quirinus Quirrell,i see myself holding the stone.
1697,Quirinus Quirrell,but how do i get it?
1698,Voldemort,use the boy.
1699,Quirinus Quirrell,come here potter.
1700,Quirinus Quirrell,now!
1701,Quirinus Quirrell,tell me... what do you see?
1702,Quirinus Quirrell,what is it?
1703,Quirinus Quirrell,what do you see?
1704,Harry Potter,i-i’m shaking hands with dumbledore.
1705,Harry Potter,i’ve won the house cup.
1706,Voldemort,he lies.
1707,Quirinus Quirrell,tell the truth!
1708,Quirinus Quirrell,what do you see?
1710,Voldemort,let me speak to him.
1711,Quirinus Quirrell,master you are not strong enough.
1712,Voldemort,i have strength enough for this.
1713,Voldemort,harry potter we meet again.
1714,Harry Potter,voldemort.
1715,Voldemort,yes.
1716,Voldemort,you see what i’ve become?
1717,Voldemort,see what i must do to survive?
1718,Voldemort,live off another a mere parasite.
1719,Voldemort,unicorn blood can sustain me but it cannot give me a body of my own.
1720,Voldemort,but there is something that can something that conveniently enough lies in your pocket.
1721,Voldemort,stop him.
1722,Voldemort,don't be a fool!
1723,Voldemort,why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?
1725,Harry Potter,never!
1726,Voldemort,haha.
1727,Voldemort,bravery.
1728,Voldemort,your parents had it too.
1729,Voldemort,tell me harry would you like to see your mother and father again?
1730,Voldemort,together we can bring them back.
1731,Voldemort,all i ask for is something in return.
1732,Voldemort,that's it harry.
1733,Voldemort,there is no good and evil.
1734,Voldemort,there is only power and those too weak to seek it.
1735,Voldemort,together we'll do extraordinary things.
1736,Voldemort,just give me the stone!
1737,Harry Potter,you liar!
1738,Voldemort,kill him!
1739,Quirinus Quirrell,ahh!
1740,Quirinus Quirrell,ahh!
1741,Quirinus Quirrell,what is this magic?
1742,Voldemort,fool!
1743,Voldemort,get the stone!
1744,Albus Dumbledore,good afternoon harry.
1745,Albus Dumbledore,ah.
1746,Albus Dumbledore,tokens from your admirers?
1747,Harry Potter,admirers?
1748,Albus Dumbledore,what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school knows.
1749,Albus Dumbledore,ah i see your friend ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your chocolate frogs.
1750,Harry Potter,ron was here?
1751,Harry Potter,is he all right?
1752,Harry Potter,what about hermione?
1753,Albus Dumbledore,fine.
1754,Albus Dumbledore,they're both just fine.
1755,Harry Potter,but what happened to the stone?
1756,Albus Dumbledore,relax dear boy.
1757,Albus Dumbledore,the stone has been destroyed.
1758,Albus Dumbledore,my friend nicholas and i had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.
1759,Harry Potter,but flamel he'll die won't he?
1760,Albus Dumbledore,he has enough elixir to set his affairs in order.
1761,Albus Dumbledore,but yes he will die.
1762,Harry Potter,how is it i got the stone sir?
1763,Harry Potter,one minute i was staring in the mirror and the next...
1764,Albus Dumbledore,ah.
1765,Albus Dumbledore,you see only a person who wanted to find the stone find it but not use it would be able to get it.
1766,Albus Dumbledore,that is one of my more brilliant ideas.
1767,Albus Dumbledore,and between you and me that's saying something.
1768,Harry Potter,does that mean with the stone gone i mean that voldemort can never come back?
1769,Albus Dumbledore,ah i'm afraid there are ways in which he can return.
1770,Albus Dumbledore,harry do you know why professor quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?
1771,Albus Dumbledore,it was because of your mother.
1772,Albus Dumbledore,she sacrificed herself for you and that kind of act leaves a mark.
1773,Albus Dumbledore,no no this kind of mark cannot be seen.
1774,Albus Dumbledore,it lives in your very skin.
1775,Harry Potter,what is it?
1776,Albus Dumbledore,love harry love.
1777,Albus Dumbledore,ah.
1778,Albus Dumbledore,bertie bott's every flavor beans.
1779,Albus Dumbledore,i was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one and since then i have lost my liking for them.
1780,Albus Dumbledore,but i think i could be safe with a nice toffee... mm.
1781,Albus Dumbledore,alas.
1782,Albus Dumbledore,earwax.
1783,Harry Potter,all right there ron?
1784,Ron Weasley,all right?
1785,Ron Weasley,you?

1787,Harry Potter,hermione?
1788,Hermione Granger,never better.
1789,Albus Dumbledore,another year gone!

1792,Albus Dumbledore,in third place: hufflepuff with 352 points!
1793,Albus Dumbledore,second: ravenclaw with 426 points!

1795,Albus Dumbledore,yes well done slytherin well done slytherin.
1796,Albus Dumbledore,however recent events must be taken into account and i have a few last minute points to award.
1797,Albus Dumbledore,first to miss hermione granger for the cool use of intellect while others were in grave peril: fifty points!

2170,Gilderoy Lockhart,when young harry stepped into flourish and blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography magical me… which incidentally is currently celebrating its 27th week atop the daily prophet bestseller list he had no idea that he would in fact be leaving… with my entire collected works free of charge.
2171,Gilderoy Lockhart,now ladies?
2172,Molly Weasley,harry now you give me those and i'll get them signed.
2173,Molly Weasley,all of you wait outside.
2174,Molly Weasley,that's it ron.
2175,Draco Malfoy,i'll bet you loved that didn't you potter?
2176,Draco Malfoy,famous harry potter!
2177,Draco Malfoy,can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page.
2178,Ginny Weasley,leave him alone.
2179,Draco Malfoy,oh look potter.
2180,Draco Malfoy,you've got yourself a girlfriend.
2181,Lucius Malfoy,now now draco play nicely.
2182,Lucius Malfoy,mr. potter… lucius malfoy.
2183,Lucius Malfoy,we meet at last.
2184,Lucius Malfoy,forgive me your scar is legend as of course is the wizard who gave it to you.
2185,Harry Potter,voldemort killed my parents.
2186,Harry Potter,he was nothing more than a murderer.
2187,Lucius Malfoy,hmm.
2188,Lucius Malfoy,you must be very brave to mention his name…or very foolish.
2189,Hermione Granger,fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself.
2190,Lucius Malfoy,and you must be… miss granger.
2191,Lucius Malfoy,yes draco's told me all about you and your parents.
2192,Lucius Malfoy,muggles aren't they?
2193,Lucius Malfoy,let me see…red hair… vacant expressions… tatty second hand book.
2194,Lucius Malfoy,you must be the weasleys.

2198,Lucius Malfoy,weasley senior.
2199,Arthur Weasley,lucius.
2200,Lucius Malfoy,busy time at the ministry arthur all those extra raids?
2201,Lucius Malfoy,i do hope they're paying you overtime but judging by the state of this i'd say not.
2202,Lucius Malfoy,what's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it.
2203,Arthur Weasley,we have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard malfoy.
2204,Lucius Malfoy,clearly.
2205,Lucius Malfoy,associating with muggles… and i thought your family could sink no lower.
2206,Lucius Malfoy,i'll see you at work.
2207,Draco Malfoy,see you at school.

2224,Harry Potter,why can't we get through?
2225,Ron Weasley,i don't know.
2226,Ron Weasley,the gateway's sealed its self for some reason.
2227,Harry Potter,the train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock.
2228,Harry Potter,we've missed it!
2229,Ron Weasley,harry if we can't get through maybe mum and dad can't get back!
2230,Harry Potter,maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
2231,Ron Weasley,the car…
2232,Harry Potter,ron i should tell you most muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car.
2233,Ron Weasley,uh right.
2234,Ron Weasley,okay.
2235,Ron Weasley,oh no!
2236,Ron Weasley,the invisibility booster must be faulty!
2237,Harry Potter,well come on then.
2238,Harry Potter,let's go lower.
2239,Harry Potter,we need to find the train.
2240,Ron Weasley,okay.
2241,Harry Potter,now all we need to do is catch up with the train.

2298,Ron Weasley,scabbers you ok?
2299,Ron Weasley,the car!
2300,Ron Weasley,…dad's gonna kill me.
2301,Harry Potter,see you hedwig.
2302,Harry Potter,so a house elf shows up in my bedroom we can't get through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters we almost get killed by a tree… clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.
2303,Argus Filch,well take a good look lads.
2304,Argus Filch,this night might well be the last you spend in this castle.
2305,Argus Filch,hm.
2306,Argus Filch,oh dear we are in trouble.
2307,Severus Snape,you were seen by no less than seven muggles.
2308,Severus Snape,do you have any idea how serious this is?
2309,Severus Snape,you have risked the exposure of our world.
2310,Severus Snape,not to mention the damage you inflicted on a whomping willow that's been on these grounds since before you were born.
2311,Ron Weasley,honestly professor snape i think it did more damage to us.
2312,Severus Snape,silence!
2313,Severus Snape,i assure you that were you in slytherin and your fate rested with me the both of you would be on the train home- tonight.
2314,Severus Snape,as it is…
2315,Albus Dumbledore,…they are not.
2316,Harry Potter,professor dumbledore.
2317,Harry Potter,professor mcgonagall.
2318,Severus Snape,headmaster these boys have flouted the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry.
2319,Severus Snape,as such--
2320,Albus Dumbledore,i am well aware of our bylaws severus having written quite a few of them myself.
2321,Albus Dumbledore,however as head of gryffindor house it is for professor mcgonagall to determine the appropriate action.
2322,Ron Weasley,we'll go and get our stuff then.
2323,Minerva McGonagall,what are you talking about mr. weasley?
2324,Ron Weasley,you're going to expel us aren't you?
2325,Minerva McGonagall,not today mr. weasley.
2326,Minerva McGonagall,but i must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done.
2327,Minerva McGonagall,i will be writing to your families tonight and you will both receive detention.
2328,Pomona Sprout,morning everyone!
2329,Pomona Sprout,good morning everyone!
2330,All,good morning professor sprout!
2331,Pomona Sprout,welcome to greenhouse three second years.
2332,Pomona Sprout,now gather around everyone.
2333,Pomona Sprout,today we are going to repot mandrakes.
2334,Pomona Sprout,who here can tell me the properties of the mandrake root?
2335,Pomona Sprout,yes miss granger.
2336,Hermione Granger,mandrake or mandragora is used to return those who have been petrified to their original state.
2337,Hermione Granger,it's also quite dangerous.
2338,Hermione Granger,the mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.
2339,Pomona Sprout,excellent!
2340,Pomona Sprout,ten points to gryffindor!
2341,Pomona Sprout,now as our mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries won't kill you yet.
2342,Pomona Sprout,but they could knock you out for several hours which is why i have given each of you a pair of earmuffs for auditory protection.
2343,Pomona Sprout,so could you please put them on right away?
2344,Pomona Sprout,quickly!
2345,Pomona Sprout,flaps tight down and watch me closely.
2346,Pomona Sprout,you grasp your mandrake firmly you pull it sharply up out of the pot…
2347,All,aah!
2348,All,ooh!
2349,Pomona Sprout,got it?
2350,Pomona Sprout,and… now you dunk it down into the other pot and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.
2351,Neville Longbottom,uhh…
2352,Pomona Sprout,uh longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs.
2353,Seamus Finnigan,no ma'am he's just fainted.
2354,Pomona Sprout,yes well just leave him there.
2355,Pomona Sprout,right!
2356,Pomona Sprout,on we go!
2357,Pomona Sprout,plenty of pots to go around.
2358,Pomona Sprout,grasp your mandrake and pull it up!

2375,Seamus Finnigan,look everyone!
2376,Seamus Finnigan,weasley's got himself a howler!
2377,Neville Longbottom,go on ron.
2378,Neville Longbottom,i ignored one from my gran once.
2379,Neville Longbottom,it was horrible.
2380,Howler,ronald weasley!
2381,Howler,how dare you steal that car!
2382,Howler,i am absolutley disgusted!
2383,Howler,your father's now facing an inquiry at work and it's entirely your fault!
2384,Howler,if you put another toe out of line we'll bring you straight home!
2385,Howler,oh and ginny dear congratulations on making gryffindor.

2389,Gilderoy Lockhart,gilderoy lockhart order of merlin third class honorary member of the dark force defense league and five-times winner of witch weekly's most-charming-smile award- but i don't talk about that.
2390,Gilderoy Lockhart,i didn't get rid of the bandon banshee by smiling at him.
2391,Gilderoy Lockhart,huh huh huh… hee hee… now- be warned!
2392,Gilderoy Lockhart,it is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind.
2393,Gilderoy Lockhart,you may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room.
2394,Gilderoy Lockhart,know only that no harm can befall you whilst i am here.
2395,Gilderoy Lockhart,i must ask you not to scream.
2396,Gilderoy Lockhart,it might… provoke them!
2397,Seamus Finnigan,cornish pixies?
2398,Gilderoy Lockhart,freshly caught cornish pixies!
2399,Seamus Finnigan,ha ha.
2400,Seamus Finnigan,ha ha ha…
2401,Gilderoy Lockhart,laugh if you will mr. finnigan but pixies can be devilish tricky little blighters.
2402,Gilderoy Lockhart,let's see what you make of them ha!
2403,Gilderoy Lockhart,come on now- round them up round them up they're only pixies!
2404,Pixie,just stay there!
2405,Neville Longbottom,ah!
2406,Neville Longbottom,aaah!

2416,Pixie,yeeee-haw!
2417,Pixie,wheee!
2418,Gilderoy Lockhart,i'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage!
2419,Ron Weasley,what do we do now?
2420,Hermione Granger,immobulus!
2421,Neville Longbottom,why is it always me?
2422,Oliver Wood,i spent the summer devising a whole new quidditch program.
2423,Oliver Wood,we are gonna train earlier harder and longer.
2424,Oliver Wood,what- i don't believe it!
2425,Oliver Wood,where do you think you're goin' flint?
2426,Marcus Flint,quidditch practice.
2427,Oliver Wood,i booked the pitch for gryffindor today.
2428,Marcus Flint,easy wood.
2429,Marcus Flint,i've got a note.
2430,Ron Weasley,uh-oh.
2431,Ron Weasley,i smell trouble.
2432,Oliver Wood,“i professor severus snape do hereby give the slytherin team permission to practice today owing to the need to train their new seeker.” you've got a new seeker.
2433,Oliver Wood,who?
2434,Harry Potter,malfoy?
2435,Draco Malfoy,that's right.
2436,Draco Malfoy,and that's not all that new this year.
2437,Ron Weasley,those are nimbus two thousand and ones!
2438,Ron Weasley,how did you get those?
2439,Marcus Flint,a gift from draco's father.
2440,Draco Malfoy,you see weasley unlike some my father can afford the best.
2441,Hermione Granger,at least no one on the gryffindor team had to buy their way in.
2442,Hermione Granger,they got it on pure talent.
2443,Draco Malfoy,no one asked your opinion you filthy little mudblood!
2444,Ron Weasley,you'll pay for that one malfoy.
2445,Ron Weasley,eat slugs!
2446,Students,ha ha ha!
2447,Draco Malfoy,ha ha!
2448,Hermione Granger,you okay ron?
2449,Hermione Granger,say something!
2450,Other,ooh!
2451,Other,ugh!
2452,Other,yech!
2453,Colin Creevey,wow!
2454,Colin Creevey,can you turn him around harry?
2455,Harry Potter,no colin!
2456,Harry Potter,get out of the way!
2457,Harry Potter,let's take him to hagrid's.
2458,Harry Potter,he'll know what to do.
2459,Students,ha ha ha…
2460,Draco Malfoy,ha ha…
2461,Rubeus Hagrid,wo this calls for a specialist's equipment.
2462,Rubeus Hagrid,nothin' to do but wait'll it stops i'm afraid.
2463,Harry Potter,ah!
2464,Harry Potter,oh… okay.
2465,Rubeus Hagrid,better out than in.
2466,Rubeus Hagrid,who's ron tryin' to curse anyway?
2467,Harry Potter,malfoy.
2468,Harry Potter,he called hermione …um well i don't- i don't know exactly what it means.
2469,Hermione Granger,he called me a mudblood.
2470,Rubeus Hagrid,he did not!
2471,Harry Potter,what's a mudblood?
2472,Hermione Granger,it means “dirty blood.” mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is muggle-born.
2473,Hermione Granger,someone with non-magic parents.
2474,Hermione Granger,someone like me.
2475,Hermione Granger,it's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
2476,Rubeus Hagrid,see the thing is harry there're some wizards like the malfoy family who think they're better'n everyone else because they're what people call “pure blood.”
2477,Harry Potter,that's horrible!
2478,Ron Weasley,it's disgusting.
2479,Rubeus Hagrid,and it's codswallop to boot.
2480,Rubeus Hagrid,“dirty blood.” why there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half blood or less.
2481,Rubeus Hagrid,more ter the point they've yet to think of a spell that our hermione can' do.
2482,Rubeus Hagrid,come here… don't you think on it hermione.
2483,Rubeus Hagrid,don't you think on it for one minute… eh?
2484,Gilderoy Lockhart,harry harry harry… can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail?
2485,Harry Potter,not really.
2486,Gilderoy Lockhart,fame is a fickle friend harry.
2487,Gilderoy Lockhart,celebrity is as celebrity does.
2488,Gilderoy Lockhart,remember that.
2489,Basilisk,come come come to me.
2490,Basilisk,come to me!
2491,Harry Potter,what?
2492,Gilderoy Lockhart,sorry?
2493,Harry Potter,that voice.
2494,Gilderoy Lockhart,voice?
2495,Harry Potter,didn't you hear it?
2496,Gilderoy Lockhart,what are you talking about harry?
2497,Gilderoy Lockhart,i think we're getting a bit a- drowsy.
2498,Gilderoy Lockhart,and great scott- no wonder!
2499,Gilderoy Lockhart,look at the time!
2500,Gilderoy Lockhart,we've been here nearly four hours!
2501,Gilderoy Lockhart,spooky how the time flies when one's having fun.
2502,Gilderoy Lockhart,heh heh.
2503,Harry Potter,spooky.
2504,Basilisk,blood.
2505,Basilisk,i smell blood.
2506,Basilisk,let me rip you.
2507,Basilisk,let me kill you.
2508,Basilisk,kill!
2509,Basilisk,kill!
2510,Hermione Granger,harry!
2511,Harry Potter,did you hear it?
2512,Ron Weasley,hear what?
2513,Harry Potter,that voice.
2514,Hermione Granger,voice?
2515,Hermione Granger,what voice?
2516,Harry Potter,i heard it first in lockhart's office.
2517,Harry Potter,and then again just—
2518,Basilisk,it's time.
2519,Harry Potter,it's moving.
2520,Harry Potter,i think it's going to kill.
2521,Ron Weasley,kill?
2522,Hermione Granger,harry wait!
2523,Hermione Granger,not so fast!
2524,Harry Potter,strange.
2525,Harry Potter,i've never seen spiders act like that.
2526,Ron Weasley,i don't like spiders… what's that?
2527,Hermione Granger,'the chamber of secrets has been opened… enemies the heir… beware.'
2528,Hermione Granger,it's written in blood.
2529,Harry Potter,oh no… it's filch's cat.
2530,Harry Potter,it's mrs. norris.
2531,Students,ahhh!
2532,Students,what's that?
2533,Poppy Pomfrey,oh!
2534,Draco Malfoy,'enemies of the heir beware!'
2535,Draco Malfoy,you'll be next mudbloods!
2536,Argus Filch,what's going on 'ere?
2537,Argus Filch,go on make way make way.
2538,Argus Filch,potter-- what are you…mrs.
2539,Argus Filch,norris?
2540,Argus Filch,you've…murdered my cat.
2541,Harry Potter,no.
2542,Harry Potter,no.
2543,Argus Filch,i'll kill ya… i'll kill ya!
2544,Albus Dumbledore,argus!
2545,Albus Dumbledore,argus i… everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately.
2546,Albus Dumbledore,everyone except… you three.
2547,Other,ravenclaws follow me!
2548,Albus Dumbledore,she's not dead argus.
2549,Albus Dumbledore,she has been petrified.
2550,Gilderoy Lockhart,ah thought so.
2551,Gilderoy Lockhart,so unlucky i wasn't there.
2552,Gilderoy Lockhart,i know exactly the counter curse that could have spared her.
2553,Albus Dumbledore,but how she has been petrified i cannot say…
2554,Argus Filch,ask him.
2555,Argus Filch,it's him who's done it.
2556,Argus Filch,you saw what he wrote on the wall.
2557,Harry Potter,it's not true sir i swear.
2558,Harry Potter,i never touched mrs. norris.
2559,Argus Filch,rubbish!
2560,Severus Snape,if i might headmaster?
2561,Severus Snape,perhaps potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.
2562,Severus Snape,however the circumstances are suspicious.
2563,Severus Snape,i for one don't recall seeing potter at dinner.
2564,Gilderoy Lockhart,i'm afraid that's my doing severus.
2565,Gilderoy Lockhart,you see harry was helping me answer my fan mail.
2566,Hermione Granger,that's why ron and i went looking for him professor.
2567,Hermione Granger,we'd just found him when he said…
2568,Severus Snape,yes miss granger?
2569,Harry Potter,when i said i wasn't hungry.
2570,Harry Potter,we were heading back to the common room when we found mrs. norris.
2571,Albus Dumbledore,innocent until proven guilty severus.
2572,Argus Filch,my cat has been petrified.
2573,Argus Filch,i wanna see some punishment!
2574,Albus Dumbledore,we will be able to cure her argus.
2575,Albus Dumbledore,as i understand it madame sprout has a very healthy growth of mandrakes.
2576,Albus Dumbledore,when matured a potion will be made which will revive mrs. norris.
2577,Albus Dumbledore,and in the meantime i strongly recommend caution… to all.
2578,Hermione Granger,it's a bit strange isn't it?
2579,Harry Potter,strange?
2580,Hermione Granger,you hear this voice a voice only you can hear and then mrs. norris turns up petrified.
2581,Hermione Granger,it's just… strange.
2582,Harry Potter,do you think i should have told them?
2583,Harry Potter,dumbledore and the others i mean?
2584,Ron Weasley,are you mad?
2585,Hermione Granger,no harry.
2586,Hermione Granger,even in the wizarding world hearing voices isn't a good sign.
2587,Man in a painting,she's right you know.
2588,Minerva McGonagall,could i have your attention please?
2589,Minerva McGonagall,right.
2590,Minerva McGonagall,now today we will be transforming animals into water goblets.
2591,Minerva McGonagall,like so.
2592,Minerva McGonagall,one two three vera verto.
2593,Minerva McGonagall,now it's your turn.
2594,Minerva McGonagall,well who would like to go first?
2595,Minerva McGonagall,ah!
2596,Minerva McGonagall,mr. weasley.
2597,Minerva McGonagall,“one two three.
2598,Minerva McGonagall,vera verto.”
2599,Ron Weasley,ahem.
2600,Ron Weasley,vera verto!
2601,Students,ha ha ha ha ha…
2602,Minerva McGonagall,that wand needs replacing mr. weasley.
2603,Minerva McGonagall,yes miss granger?
2604,Hermione Granger,professor i was wondering if you could tell us about…the chamber of secrets?
2605,Minerva McGonagall,well very well.
2606,Minerva McGonagall,well you all know of course that hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: godric gryffindor helga hufflepuff rowena ravenclaw and salazar slytherin.
2607,Minerva McGonagall,now three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously.
2608,Minerva McGonagall,one did not.
2609,Ron Weasley,three guesses who.
2610,Minerva McGonagall,salazar slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to hogwarts.
2611,Minerva McGonagall,he believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.
2612,Minerva McGonagall,in other words “pure-bloods.” unable to sway the others he decided to leave the school.
2613,Minerva McGonagall,now according to legend slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle known as the chamber of secrets.
2614,Minerva McGonagall,though shortly before departing he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school.
2615,Minerva McGonagall,the heir alone would be able to open the chamber and unleash the horror within and by so doing purge the school of all those who in slytherin's view were unworthy to study magic.
2616,Hermione Granger,muggle-borns.
2617,Minerva McGonagall,well naturally the school had been searched many times.
2618,Minerva McGonagall,no such chamber has been found.
2619,Hermione Granger,professor?
2620,Hermione Granger,what exactly does legend tell us lies within the chamber?
2621,Minerva McGonagall,well the chamber is said to home to something that only the heir of slytherin can control.
2622,Minerva McGonagall,it is said to be the home of a monster.
2623,Ron Weasley,d'you think it's true?
2624,Ron Weasley,d'you think there really is a chamber of secrets?
2625,Hermione Granger,yes.
2626,Hermione Granger,couldn't you tell?
2627,Hermione Granger,mcgonagall's worried.
2628,Hermione Granger,all the teachers are.
2629,Harry Potter,well if there really is a chamber of secrets a-and it really has been opened then that means---
2630,Hermione Granger,the heir of slytherin has returned to hogwarts.
2631,Hermione Granger,the question is who is it?
2632,Ron Weasley,let's think.
2633,Ron Weasley,who do we know who thinks all muggle-borns are scum?
2634,Hermione Granger,if you're talking about malfoy.
2635,Ron Weasley,of course.
2636,Ron Weasley,you heard him!
2637,Ron Weasley,'you'll be next mudbloods'
2638,Hermione Granger,i heard him.
2639,Hermione Granger,but malfoy the heir of slytherin?
2640,Harry Potter,well maybe ron's right hermione.
2641,Harry Potter,i mean look at his family.
2642,Harry Potter,the whole lot of them have been in slytherin for centuries.
2643,Ron Weasley,crabbe and goyle must know.
2644,Ron Weasley,maybe we could trick them into telling.
2645,Hermione Granger,even they aren't that thick.
2646,Hermione Granger,but there might be another way.
2647,Hermione Granger,mind you it would be difficult.
2648,Hermione Granger,not to mention we would be breaking about fifty school rules.
2649,Hermione Granger,and it'll be dangerous.
2650,Hermione Granger,very dangerous.
2651,Hermione Granger,here it is.
2652,Hermione Granger,'the polyjuice potion.'
2653,Hermione Granger,'properly brewed the polyjuice potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.'
2654,Ron Weasley,do you mean if harry and i drink that stuff we'll turn into crabbe and goyle?
2655,Hermione Granger,yes.
2656,Ron Weasley,wicked!
2657,Ron Weasley,malfoy'll tell us anything.
2658,Hermione Granger,exactly.
2659,Hermione Granger,but it's tricky.
2660,Hermione Granger,i've never seen a more complicated potion.
2661,Harry Potter,well how long will it take to make?
2662,Hermione Granger,a month.
2663,Harry Potter,a month?
2664,Harry Potter,but hermione if malfoy is the heir of slytherin he could attack half the muggle-borns in the school by then.
2665,Hermione Granger,i know.
2666,Hermione Granger,but it's the only plan we've got.
2667,Students,yeah!
2668,Students,come on slytherin!
2669,Lee Jordan,another goal for slytherin!
2670,Lee Jordan,they lead gryffindor ninety to thirty!
2671,Marcus Flint,yeah!
2672,Marcus Flint,yeah!
2673,Draco Malfoy,all right there scarhead?
2674,Oliver Wood,watch yourself harry!
2675,Harry Potter,wood!
2676,Harry Potter,look out!
2677,Rubeus Hagrid,blimey!
2678,Rubeus Hagrid,harry's got himself a rogue bludger!
2679,Rubeus Hagrid,that's been tampered with that has!
2680,Ron Weasley,i'll stop it.
2681,Hermione Granger,no!
2682,Hermione Granger,even with a proper wand it's too risky.
2683,Hermione Granger,you could hit harry!
2684,Draco Malfoy,training for the ballet potter?
2685,Draco Malfoy,you'll never catch me potter!
2686,Hermione Granger,let's go.
2687,Lee Jordan,harry potter has caught the snitch!
2688,Lee Jordan,gryffindor wins!
2689,Hermione Granger,finite incantatem!
2690,Harry Potter,thank you.
2691,Hermione Granger,are you okay?
2692,Harry Potter,no i think my- i think my arm's broken.
2693,Gilderoy Lockhart,not to worry harry.
2694,Gilderoy Lockhart,i will fix that arm of yours straight away.
2695,Harry Potter,no not you.
2696,Gilderoy Lockhart,oh poor boy doesn't know what he's saying.
2697,Gilderoy Lockhart,now this… won't hurt a bit.
2698,Gilderoy Lockhart,brackium emendo!
2699,Students,oh!
2700,Students,ooh!
2701,Students,ugh!
2702,Gilderoy Lockhart,ah yes well ha that can sometimes happen um butuh the point is uh…
2703,Other,ohh!
2704,Other,uhh!
2705,Gilderoy Lockhart,…you can no longer feel any pain and heh- very clearly the bones are not broken.
2706,Rubeus Hagrid,broken?
2707,Rubeus Hagrid,there's no bones left!
2708,Students,uh-huh-ugh!
2709,Gilderoy Lockhart,much more flexible though.
2710,Draco Malfoy,uhh uhhh…
2711,Poppy Pomfrey,oh mr. malfoy stop making such a fuss you can go.
2712,Poppy Pomfrey,out of my way.
2713,Poppy Pomfrey,out of my way!
2714,Poppy Pomfrey,should've been brought straight to me.
2715,Poppy Pomfrey,i can mend bones in a heartbeat- but growing them back…
2716,Hermione Granger,you will be able to won't you?
2717,Poppy Pomfrey,oh i'll be able to certainly.
2718,Poppy Pomfrey,but it'll be painful.
2719,Poppy Pomfrey,you're in for a rough night potter.
2720,Poppy Pomfrey,regrowing bones is a nasty business.
2721,Harry Potter,ugh!
2722,Poppy Pomfrey,well what do you expect?
2723,Poppy Pomfrey,pumpkin juice?
2724,Harry Potter,uh!
2725,Basilisk,kill.
2726,Basilisk,kill… time to kill!
2727,Dobby,hello!
2728,Harry Potter,dobby?
2729,Dobby,harry potter should have listened to dobby!
2730,Dobby,harry potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.
2731,Harry Potter,it was you… you stopped the barrier from letting ron and me through.
2732,Dobby,indeed.
2733,Dobby,yes sir.
2734,Harry Potter,you nearly got ron and me expelled!
2735,Dobby,at least you would be away from here.
2736,Dobby,harry potter must go home!
2737,Dobby,dobby thought his bludger would be enough to make harry potter see that---
2738,Harry Potter,your bludger?
2739,Harry Potter,you made that bludger chase after me?
2740,Dobby,uhuh… dobby feels most aggrieved sir.
2741,Dobby,dobby had to iron his hands.
2742,Harry Potter,you'd better clear off before my bones come back dobby or i might strangle you!
2743,Dobby,uh-huh-huh… dobby is used to death threats sir.
2744,Dobby,dobby gets them five times a day at home.
2745,Harry Potter,i don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
2746,Dobby,not kill you sir never kill you!
2747,Dobby,dobby remembers how it was before harry potter triumphed over he-who-must-not-be-named.
2748,Dobby,we house elves were treated like vermin sir.
2749,Dobby,of course dobby is still treated like vermin…uh huh huh huh!
2750,Dobby,aah ahh…
2751,Harry Potter,why do you wear that thing dobby?
2752,Dobby,this sir?
2753,Dobby,it is a mark of the house-elves' enslavement.
2754,Dobby,dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes.
2755,Dobby,ah!
2756,Dobby,listen.
2757,Dobby,listen!
2758,Dobby,terrible things are about to happen at hogwarts.
2759,Dobby,harry potter must not stay here now that history is to repeat itself.
2760,Harry Potter,repeat itself?
2761,Harry Potter,you mean this has happened before?
2762,Dobby,ah!
2763,Dobby,i shouldn't have said that!
2764,Dobby,oh!
2765,Dobby,ah!
2766,Dobby,dah!
2767,Dobby,bad dobby!
2768,Dobby,bad!
2769,Harry Potter,dobby stop it!
2770,Harry Potter,stop it!
2771,Harry Potter,stop dobby!
2772,Harry Potter,tell me dobby.
2773,Harry Potter,when did this happen before?
2774,Harry Potter,who's doing it now?
2775,Dobby,dobby cannot say sir.
2776,Dobby,dobby only wants harry potter to be safe.
2777,Harry Potter,no dobby.
2778,Harry Potter,tell me.
2779,Harry Potter,who is it?
2780,Poppy Pomfrey,put him here.
2781,Poppy Pomfrey,what happened?
2782,Albus Dumbledore,there's been another attack.
2783,Minerva McGonagall,i think- do ya know- i think he's been petrified madame pomfrey.
2784,Minerva McGonagall,look!
2785,Minerva McGonagall,perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker…
2786,Minerva McGonagall,what can this mean albus?
2787,Albus Dumbledore,it means…that our students are in great danger.
2788,Minerva McGonagall,what should i tell the staff.
2789,Albus Dumbledore,the truth.
2790,Albus Dumbledore,tell them hogwarts is no longer safe.
2791,Albus Dumbledore,it is as we feared minerva.
2792,Albus Dumbledore,the chamber of secrets has indeed been opened again.
2793,Hermione Granger,again?
2794,Hermione Granger,you mean the chamber of secrets has been opened before?
2795,Ron Weasley,of course.
2796,Ron Weasley,don't you see?
2797,Ron Weasley,lucius malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here.
2798,Ron Weasley,and now he's taught draco how to do it.
2799,Hermione Granger,maybe.
2800,Hermione Granger,we'll have to wait for the polyjuice potion to know for sure.
2801,Ron Weasley,enlighten me.
2802,Ron Weasley,why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight in the middle of a girl's lavatory?
2803,Ron Weasley,don't you think we'll get caught?
2804,Hermione Granger,heh… no.
2805,Hermione Granger,no one ever comes in here.
2806,Ron Weasley,why?
2807,Hermione Granger,moaning myrtle.
2808,Ron Weasley,who?
2809,Hermione Granger,moaning myrtle.
2810,Ron Weasley,who's moaning myrtle?
2811,Moaning Myrtle,i'm moaning myrtle!
2812,Moaning Myrtle,i wouldn't expect you to know me!
2813,Moaning Myrtle,who would ever talk about ugly miserable moping moaning myrtle?
2814,Moaning Myrtle,huh…aaaah!
2815,Hermione Granger,she's a little sensitive.
2816,Gilderoy Lockhart,gather 'round gather 'round!
2817,Gilderoy Lockhart,can everybody see me?
2818,Gilderoy Lockhart,can you all hear me?
2819,Gilderoy Lockhart,excellent!
2820,Gilderoy Lockhart,in light of the dark events of recent weeks professor dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves as i myself have done on countless occasions- for full details see my published works.
2821,Gilderoy Lockhart,let me introduce my assistant professor snape.
2822,Gilderoy Lockhart,he has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration.
2823,Gilderoy Lockhart,now i don't want any of you youngsters to worry- you'll still have your potions master when i'm through with him never fear.
2824,Gilderoy Lockhart,one two three.
2825,Severus Snape,expelliarmus!
2826,Gilderoy Lockhart,whoaah!
2827,Hermione Granger,do you think he's all right?
2828,Ron Weasley,who cares?
2829,Gilderoy Lockhart,an excellent idea to show them that professor snape but if you don't mind me saying it was pretty obvious- ah- what you were about to do.
2830,Gilderoy Lockhart,and if i had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy.
2831,Severus Snape,perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells professor.
2832,Gilderoy Lockhart,an excellent suggestion professor snape!
2833,Gilderoy Lockhart,ah… let's have a volunteer pair!
2834,Gilderoy Lockhart,um potter weasley how about you?
2835,Severus Snape,weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells.
2836,Severus Snape,we'll be sending potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox.
2837,Severus Snape,might i suggest someone from my own house?
2838,Severus Snape,malfoy perhaps?
2839,Gilderoy Lockhart,good luck potter.
2840,Harry Potter,thank you sir.
2841,Gilderoy Lockhart,wands at the ready.
2842,Draco Malfoy,scared potter?
2843,Harry Potter,you wish.
2844,Gilderoy Lockhart,on the count of three cast your charms to disarm your opponent- only to disarm.
2845,Gilderoy Lockhart,we don't want any accidents here.
2846,Gilderoy Lockhart,one two--
2847,Draco Malfoy,everte statium!
2848,Hermione Granger,oh!
2849,Vincent Crabbe,ha ha ha ha ha!
2850,Harry Potter,rictusempra!
2851,Gilderoy Lockhart,i said disarm only!
2852,Draco Malfoy,serpensortia!
2853,Severus Snape,don't move potter.
2854,Severus Snape,i'll get rid of it for you.
2855,Gilderoy Lockhart,allow me professor snape.
2856,Gilderoy Lockhart,alarte ascendare!
2857,Harry Potter,sya- hassa- she.
2858,Harry Potter,sya- hasi- heth.
2859,Harry Potter,sya- hasi- heth.
2860,Severus Snape,vipera evenesca.
2861,Justin Finch-Fletchley,what are you playing at?
2862,Ron Weasley,you're a parselmouth?
2863,Ron Weasley,why didn't you tell us?
2864,Harry Potter,i'm a what?
2865,Hermione Granger,you can talk to snakes.
2866,Harry Potter,i know.
2867,Harry Potter,i mean i accidentally set a python on my cousin dudley at the zoo once.
2868,Harry Potter,uh once!
2869,Harry Potter,but so what?
2870,Harry Potter,i bet loads of people here can do it.
2871,Hermione Granger,no they can't.
2872,Hermione Granger,it's not a very common gift harry.
2873,Hermione Granger,this is bad.
2874,Harry Potter,what's bad?
2875,Harry Potter,if i hadn't told that snake not to attack justin.
2876,Ron Weasley,oh that's what you said to it!
2877,Harry Potter,you were there!
2878,Harry Potter,you heard me!
2879,Ron Weasley,i heard you speaking parseltongue.
2880,Ron Weasley,snake language?
2881,Harry Potter,i spoke a different language?
2882,Harry Potter,but- i didn't realize i- how can i speak a language without knowing i can?
2883,Hermione Granger,i don't know harry but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something.
2884,Hermione Granger,harry listen to me.
2885,Hermione Granger,there's a reason the symbol of slytherin house is a serpent.
2886,Hermione Granger,salazar slytherin was a parselmouth.
2887,Hermione Granger,he could talk to snakes too.
2888,Ron Weasley,exactly!
2889,Ron Weasley,now the whole school's gonna think you're his great- greatgreat grandson or something.
2890,Harry Potter,but i'm not… i can't be.
2891,Hermione Granger,he lived a thousand years ago; for all we know you could be.
2892,Students,nan
2893,Harry Potter,i'll see you back in the common room.
2894,Basilisk,blood…i want blood…they all must die.
2895,Basilisk,kill… kill… kill!
2896,Basilisk,time to kill.
2897,Argus Filch,caught in the act!
2898,Argus Filch,i'll have you out this time potter.
2899,Argus Filch,mark my words.
2900,Harry Potter,no!
2901,Harry Potter,mr. filch!
2902,Harry Potter,y-you- you don't understand!
2903,Minerva McGonagall,oh!
2904,Harry Potter,professor… i swear i didn't!
2905,Minerva McGonagall,this is out of my hands potter.
2906,Minerva McGonagall,professor dumbledore will be waiting for you.
2907,Minerva McGonagall,sherbet lemon.
2908,Harry Potter,professor dumbledore?
2909,Sorting Hat,bee in your bonnet potter?
2910,Harry Potter,i… i-i was- i was just wondering if you'd put me in the right house.
2911,Sorting Hat,yes you were particularly difficult to place.
2912,Sorting Hat,but i stand by what i said last year-- you would have done well in slytherin.
2913,Harry Potter,you're wrong.
2914,Sorting Hat,umm…
2915,Albus Dumbledore,harry?
2916,Harry Potter,professor!
2917,Harry Potter,sir your bird- there was nothing i could do- he- he just caught fire!
2918,Albus Dumbledore,oh and about time too.
2919,Albus Dumbledore,he's been looking dreadful for days.
2920,Albus Dumbledore,pity you had to see him on a burning day.
2921,Albus Dumbledore,fawkes is a phoenix harry.
2922,Albus Dumbledore,they burst into flame when it is time for them to die and then they are reborn from the ashes.
2923,Albus Dumbledore,ah fascinating creatures phoenixes.
2924,Albus Dumbledore,they can carry immensely heavy loads and their- their tears have healing powers.
2925,Rubeus Hagrid,professor dumbledore sir!
2926,Rubeus Hagrid,wait!
2927,Rubeus Hagrid,listen!
2928,Rubeus Hagrid,professor dumbledore sir it wasn't harry!
2929,Albus Dumbledore,hagrid.
2930,Rubeus Hagrid,in fact i'd be prepared ter swear it in front o' the ministry of magic!
2931,Albus Dumbledore,hagrid!
2932,Albus Dumbledore,relax.
2933,Albus Dumbledore,i do not believe that harry attacked anyone.
2934,Rubeus Hagrid,well of course you don't and… oh… oh right.
2935,Rubeus Hagrid,well i'll umhum.
2936,Rubeus Hagrid,i'll just wait outside then.
2937,Albus Dumbledore,yes.
2938,Harry Potter,you don't think it was me professor?
2939,Albus Dumbledore,no harry.
2940,Albus Dumbledore,i do not think it was you… but i must ask you is there something you wish to tell me?
2941,Harry Potter,no sir.
2942,Harry Potter,nothing.
2943,Albus Dumbledore,very well then.
2944,Albus Dumbledore,off you go.
2945,Hermione Granger,everything's set.
2946,Hermione Granger,we just need a bit of who you're changing into.
2947,Harry Potter,crabbe and goyle.
2948,Hermione Granger,we also need to make sure that the real crabbe and goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating malfoy.
2949,Ron Weasley,how?
2950,Hermione Granger,i've got it all worked out.
2951,Hermione Granger,i filled these with a simple sleeping draught.
2952,Hermione Granger,simple but powerful.
2953,Hermione Granger,now once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs and put on their uniforms.
2954,Ron Weasley,whose hair are you ripping out then?
2955,Hermione Granger,i've already got mine.
2956,Hermione Granger,millicent bulstrode– slytherin- i got this off her robes.
2957,Hermione Granger,i'm going to go check on the polyjuice potion.
2958,Hermione Granger,make sure that crabbe and goyle find these.
2959,Ron Weasley,ahem…

2984,Harry Potter,excellent.
2985,Ron Weasley,but where's hermione?

3005,Harry Potter,ah- um… reading.
3006,Draco Malfoy,reading?
3007,Harry Potter,uh-huh.
3008,Draco Malfoy,i didn't know you could read.
3009,Draco Malfoy,and what are you doing down here weasley?
3010,Percy Weasley,mind your attitude malfoy.
3011,Draco Malfoy,well sit down.
3012,Draco Malfoy,you'd never know the weasleys were pure-bloods the way they behave.
3013,Draco Malfoy,they're an embarrassment to the wizarding world.
3014,Draco Malfoy,all of them.
3015,Draco Malfoy,what's wrong with you crabbe?
3016,Ron Weasley,ahem…stomachache.
3017,Draco Malfoy,you know i'm surprised that the daily prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks.
3018,Draco Malfoy,i suppose dumbledore is trying to hush it all up.
3019,Draco Malfoy,father always said dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place.
3020,Harry Potter,you're wrong!
3021,Draco Malfoy,what?
3022,Draco Malfoy,you think there's someone here who's worse than dumbledore?
3023,Harry Potter,harry potter?
3024,Draco Malfoy,good one goyle.
3025,Draco Malfoy,you're absolutely right.
3026,Draco Malfoy,saint potter.
3027,Draco Malfoy,and people actually think that he's the heir of slytherin!
3028,Harry Potter,but then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
3029,Draco Malfoy,you know i don't goyle.
3030,Draco Malfoy,i told you yesterday.
3031,Draco Malfoy,how many times do i have to tell you?
3032,Draco Malfoy,is this yours?
3033,Draco Malfoy,but my father did say this: it's been fifty years since the chamber was opened.
3034,Draco Malfoy,he wouldn't tell me who opened it-- only that they were expelled.
3035,Draco Malfoy,the last time the chamber of secrets was opened a mudblood died.
3036,Draco Malfoy,so it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time.
3037,Draco Malfoy,as for me i hope it's granger.
3038,Draco Malfoy,what's the matter with you two?
3039,Draco Malfoy,you're acting very…odd.
3040,Harry Potter,it's his… stomachache.
3041,Harry Potter,calm down.
3042,Ron Weasley,s- scar.
3043,Harry Potter,hair!
3044,Draco Malfoy,hey!
3045,Draco Malfoy,where are you going?
3046,Ron Weasley,that was close!
3047,Harry Potter,hermione come out.
3048,Harry Potter,we've got loads to tell you!
3049,Hermione Granger,go away!

3052,Moaning Myrtle,it's awful!
3053,Moaning Myrtle,he- ha ha he- hee!
3054,Harry Potter,hermione?
3055,Harry Potter,a- are you ok?
3056,Moaning Myrtle,aaah!
3057,Hermione Granger,do you remember me telling you that the polyjuice potion was only for human transformations?
3058,Hermione Granger,it was cat's hair i plucked off millicent bulstrode's robes.
3059,Hermione Granger,look at my face.
3060,Moaning Myrtle,hee ha ha!
3061,Ron Weasley,look at your tail!
3062,Moaning Myrtle,ha ha ha!
3063,Ron Weasley,have you spoken to hermione?
3064,Harry Potter,she should be out of hospital in a few days when she stops coughing up fur balls… what's this?
3065,Ron Weasley,yuck!
3066,Harry Potter,looks like moaning myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
3067,Moaning Myrtle,oooh oooh ooooh huh– huh.
3068,Moaning Myrtle,come to throw something else at me?
3069,Harry Potter,why would i throw something at you?
3070,Moaning Myrtle,don't ask me!
3071,Moaning Myrtle,here i am minding my own business and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me.
3072,Ron Weasley,but it can't hurt if someone throws something at you.
3073,Ron Weasley,i mean it'll just go right through you.
3074,Moaning Myrtle,sure!
3075,Moaning Myrtle,let's all throw books at myrtle because she can't feel it!
3076,Moaning Myrtle,ten points if you get through her stomach!
3077,Moaning Myrtle,fifty points if it goes through her head!
3078,Harry Potter,but who threw it at you anyway?
3079,Moaning Myrtle,i don't know i didn't see them.
3080,Moaning Myrtle,i was just sitting in the ubend thinking about death - aah - and it fell through the top of my head.
3081,Moaning Myrtle,uhhuh.
3082,Moaning Myrtle,whoo-oooh-whoooo…

3103,Albus Dumbledore,they are true.
3104,Voldemort,about the school as well?

3106,Voldemort,they wouldn't really close hogwarts would they professor?
3107,Albus Dumbledore,i understand tom but i'm afraid headmaster dippet may have no choice.

3119,Rubeus Hagrid,you can't!
3120,Rubeus Hagrid,you don't understand.
3121,Voldemort,the dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow.
3122,Voldemort,the least hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.
3123,Rubeus Hagrid,it wasn't him.
3124,Rubeus Hagrid,aragog never killed no one!
3125,Rubeus Hagrid,never!

3140,Harry Potter,woah!
3141,Harry Potter,it was hagrid.
3142,Harry Potter,hagrid opened the chanter of secrets fifty years ago.
3143,Hermione Granger,it can't be hagrid.
3144,Hermione Granger,it just can't be.
3145,Ron Weasley,we don't even know this tom riddle.
3146,Ron Weasley,he sounds like a dirty rotten snitch to me.
3147,Harry Potter,the monster had killed somebody ron.
3148,Harry Potter,what would any of us have done?
3149,Hermione Granger,look.
3150,Hermione Granger,hagrid's our friend.
3151,Hermione Granger,why don't we just go and ask him about it?
3152,Ron Weasley,that'll be a cheerful visit!
3153,Ron Weasley,“hello hagrid!
3154,Ron Weasley,tell us have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?”
3155,Rubeus Hagrid,mad and hairy?
3156,Rubeus Hagrid,you wouldn't be talking about me now would ya?
3157,Harry Potter,no!
3158,Ron Weasley,no!
3159,Hermione Granger,no!
3160,Harry Potter,w- what's that you've got hagrid?
3161,Rubeus Hagrid,oh it's a- flesh-eatin' slug repellent.
3162,Rubeus Hagrid,for the mandrakes ya know.
3163,Rubeus Hagrid,now accordin' to professor sprout they've still got a bit o' growing up to do.
3164,Rubeus Hagrid,but once their acne's cleared up we'll be able to chop 'em up and stew 'em and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-petrified.
3165,Rubeus Hagrid,in the meantime though you three had best be lookin' after yourselves.
3166,Rubeus Hagrid,all right?
3167,Rubeus Hagrid,hmm.
3168,Rubeus Hagrid,hello neville!
3169,Neville Longbottom,harry- i don't know who did it but you'd better come!
3170,Neville Longbottom,come on!
3171,Hermione Granger,it had to be a gryffindor.
3172,Hermione Granger,nobody else knows our password- unless it wasn't a student.
3173,Ron Weasley,who ever it was they must have been looking for something.
3174,Harry Potter,and they found it.
3175,Harry Potter,tom riddle's diary is gone.
3176,Oliver Wood,alright listen up.
3177,Oliver Wood,we play our game hufflepuff doesn't stand a
3178,Fred Weasley,and not to mention they're dead scared that harry'll petrify them if they fly anywhere near him.
3179,Oliver Wood,well that too.
3180,Oliver Wood,professor mcgonagall.
3181,Minerva McGonagall,this match has been cancelled.
3182,Oliver Wood,we can't cancel quidditch.
3183,Minerva McGonagall,silence wood.
3184,Minerva McGonagall,you and your teammates will go to gryffindor tower now.
3185,Minerva McGonagall,potter you and i will find mr. weasley.
3186,Minerva McGonagall,there's something the both of you have to see.
3187,Minerva McGonagall,i warn you this could be a wee bit of a shock.
3188,Ron Weasley,hermione!
3189,Minerva McGonagall,she was found near the library along with this.
3190,Minerva McGonagall,does it mean anything to either of you?
3191,Harry Potter,no.
3192,Minerva McGonagall,could i have your attention please?
3193,Minerva McGonagall,because of recent events these new rules will be put into effect immediately.
3194,Minerva McGonagall,“all students will return to their house common rooms by six o'clock every evening.
3195,Minerva McGonagall,all students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher.
3196,Minerva McGonagall,no exceptions.” i should tell you this: unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught it is likely the school will be closed.
3197,Harry Potter,we've got to talk to hagrid ron.
3198,Harry Potter,i can't believe it's him but if he did set the monster loose last time he'll know how to get inside the chamber of secrets and that's a start.
3199,Ron Weasley,but you heard mcgonagall!
3200,Ron Weasley,we're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
3201,Harry Potter,i think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.
3202,Rubeus Hagrid,who's there?
3203,Rubeus Hagrid,hello?
3204,Rubeus Hagrid,hello?
3205,Harry Potter,what's that for?
3206,Rubeus Hagrid,oh nothing.
3207,Rubeus Hagrid,i- i was expecting ah… it doesn't matter- come on ini just made a pot o' tea.
3208,Harry Potter,hagrid are you okay?
3209,Rubeus Hagrid,i'm fine!
3210,Rubeus Hagrid,i'm alright.
3211,Harry Potter,did you hear about hermione?
3212,Rubeus Hagrid,oh yeah.
3213,Rubeus Hagrid,i heard about that all righ'.
3214,Harry Potter,look we have to ask you something.
3215,Harry Potter,do you know who's opened the chamber of secrets?
3216,Rubeus Hagrid,what you had to understand about that is—  quick under the cloak.
3217,Rubeus Hagrid,don't say a word.
3218,Rubeus Hagrid,be quiet both o' you… professor dumbledore sir!
3219,Albus Dumbledore,good evening hagrid.
3220,Albus Dumbledore,i wonder could we…?
3221,Rubeus Hagrid,of course!
3222,Rubeus Hagrid,come in!
3223,Rubeus Hagrid,come in.
3224,Ron Weasley,that's dad's boss!
3225,Ron Weasley,cornelius fudge minister of magic!
3226,Cornelius Fudge,bad business hagrid.
3227,Cornelius Fudge,very bad business.
3228,Cornelius Fudge,had to come-- three attacks on muggle-borns.
3229,Cornelius Fudge,things have gone far enough.
3230,Cornelius Fudge,the ministry's got to act.
3231,Rubeus Hagrid,oh but i never- you know i never professor!
3232,Albus Dumbledore,i want it understood cornelius that hagrid has my full confidence.
3233,Cornelius Fudge,albus look hagrid's record is against him.
3234,Cornelius Fudge,i've got to take him.
3235,Rubeus Hagrid,take me?
3236,Rubeus Hagrid,take me where?
3237,Rubeus Hagrid,not azkaban prison?
3238,Cornelius Fudge,i'm afraid we have no choice hagrid.
3239,Lucius Malfoy,already here fudge?
3240,Lucius Malfoy,good…
3241,Rubeus Hagrid,what're you doin' here?
3242,Rubeus Hagrid,get outta my house!
3243,Lucius Malfoy,believe me i take absolutely no pleasure being inside your-- you call this a house?
3244,Lucius Malfoy,huh!
3245,Lucius Malfoy,no.
3246,Lucius Malfoy,i simply called at the school and was told the headmaster was here.
3247,Albus Dumbledore,well what exactly is it that you want with me?
3248,Lucius Malfoy,the other governors and i have decided it's time for you to step aside.
3249,Lucius Malfoy,this is an order of suspension.
3250,Lucius Malfoy,you'll find all twelve signatures on it.
3251,Lucius Malfoy,i'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch.
3252,Lucius Malfoy,well what with all these attacks there'll be no muggle-borns left at hogwarts.
3253,Lucius Malfoy,i can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school.
3254,Rubeus Hagrid,yeh can' take professor dumbledore away.
3255,Rubeus Hagrid,take him away an' the muggle-borns won' stand a chance!
3256,Rubeus Hagrid,you mark my words there'll be killin's next!
3257,Lucius Malfoy,you think so?
3258,Albus Dumbledore,calm yourself hagrid.
3259,Albus Dumbledore,if the governors desire my removal i will of course step aside.
3260,Albus Dumbledore,however you will find that help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it.
3261,Lucius Malfoy,admirable sentiments.
3262,Lucius Malfoy,shall we?
3263,Lucius Malfoy,fudge!
3264,Cornelius Fudge,come hagrid… well?
3265,Rubeus Hagrid,ahem!
3266,Rubeus Hagrid,if uh if anybody was looking for some stuff then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders.
3267,Rubeus Hagrid,yup!
3268,Rubeus Hagrid,that would lead them right!
3269,Rubeus Hagrid,that's all i have to say.
3270,Rubeus Hagrid,oh and someone'll need to feed fang while i'm away.
3271,Cornelius Fudge,good boy.
3272,Ron Weasley,hagrid's right!
3273,Ron Weasley,with dumbledore gone there'll be an attack a day!
3274,Harry Potter,look!
3275,Harry Potter,well come on.
3276,Harry Potter,come on fang!
3277,Ron Weasley,what?
3279,Harry Potter,you heard what hagrid said; 'follow the spiders.'
3280,Ron Weasley,they're headed to the dark forest!
3281,Ron Weasley,why spiders!
3282,Ron Weasley,why couldn't it be “follow the butterflies?”
3283,Ron Weasley,harry i don't like this… harry i don't like this at all!
3284,Harry Potter,shush!
3285,Ron Weasley,can we go back now?
3286,Harry Potter,come on!
3287,Aragog,who is it?
3288,Harry Potter,don't panic.
3289,Aragog,hagrid?
3290,Aragog,is that you?
3291,Harry Potter,we're friends of hagrid's.
3292,Harry Potter,and you?
3293,Harry Potter,y- y-you're aragog aren't you?
3294,Aragog,yes.
3295,Aragog,hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.
3296,Harry Potter,he's in trouble.
3297,Harry Potter,up at the school there have been attacks.
3298,Harry Potter,they think it's hagrid.
3299,Harry Potter,they think he opened the chamber of secrets like before.
3300,Aragog,that's a lie!
3301,Aragog,hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets.
3302,Harry Potter,then you're not the monster.
3303,Aragog,no!
3304,Aragog,the monster was born in the castle.
3305,Aragog,i came to hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler.
3306,Ron Weasley,harry.
3307,Harry Potter,shush.
3308,Harry Potter,but if you're not the monster then- then what did kill that girl fifty years ago?
3309,Aragog,we do not speak of it.
3310,Aragog,it is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.
3311,Harry Potter,but have you seen it?
3312,Aragog,i never saw any part of the castle but the box in which hagrid kept me.
3313,Aragog,the girl was discovered in a bathroom.
3314,Aragog,when i was accused hagrid brought me here.
3315,Ron Weasley,harry!
3316,Harry Potter,what?
3317,Ron Weasley,ahh- hhh…
3318,Harry Potter,well thank you.
3319,Harry Potter,we'll just…go.
3320,Aragog,go?
3321,Aragog,i think not.
3322,Aragog,my sons and daughters do not harm hagrid on my command.
3323,Aragog,but i cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst.
3324,Aragog,good-bye friend of hagrid.
3325,Ron Weasley,can we panic now?
3326,Ron Weasley,know any spells?
3327,Harry Potter,one but it's not powerful enough for all of them.
3328,Ron Weasley,where's hermione when you need her?
3329,Harry Potter,let's go!
3330,Harry Potter,arania exumai!
3331,Harry Potter,go!
3332,Harry Potter,whoah!
3333,Ron Weasley,whoah!
3334,Ron Weasley,glad we're out of there!
3335,Ron Weasley,ah- aaaah!
3336,Harry Potter,arania exumai!
3337,Ron Weasley,thanks for that.
3338,Harry Potter,don't mention it.
3339,Harry Potter,get us out of here.
3340,Harry Potter,now!
3341,Harry Potter,come on!
3342,Harry Potter,come on!
3343,Harry Potter,move faster!
3344,Harry Potter,aah!
3345,Ron Weasley,aah!
3346,Harry Potter,go on!
3347,Harry Potter,go!
3348,Harry Potter,get us in the air.
3349,Ron Weasley,the flying gear's jammed!
3350,Harry Potter,come on!
3351,Harry Potter,pull!
3352,Ron Weasley,i'm trying!
3353,Ron Weasley,follow the spiders!
3354,Ron Weasley,follow the spiders!
3355,Ron Weasley,if hagrid ever gets out of azkaban i'll kill him!
3356,Ron Weasley,i mean what was the point of sending us in there?
3357,Ron Weasley,what have we found out?
3358,Harry Potter,we know one thing.
3359,Harry Potter,hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets.
3360,Harry Potter,he was innocent.
3361,Harry Potter,wish you were here hermione.
3362,Harry Potter,we need you… now more than ever.
3363,Ron Weasley,what's that?
3364,Harry Potter,ron this is why hermione was in the library the day she was attacked.
3365,Harry Potter,come on!
3366,Harry Potter,'of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land none is more deadly than the basilisk.
3367,Harry Potter,capable of living for hundreds of years instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye.
3368,Harry Potter,spiders flee before it.'
3369,Harry Potter,ron this is it.
3370,Harry Potter,the monster in the chamber of secrets is a basilisk.
3371,Harry Potter,that's why i can hear it speak.
3372,Harry Potter,it's a snake!
3373,Ron Weasley,but if it kills by looking people in the eye why is it no one's dead?
3374,Harry Potter,because no one did look it in the eye.
3375,Harry Potter,not directly at least.
3376,Harry Potter,colin saw it through his camera.
3377,Harry Potter,justin…justin must have seen the basilisk through nearly headless nick.
3378,Harry Potter,nick got the full blast of it- but he's a ghost- he couldn't die again.
3379,Harry Potter,and hermione…had the mirror.
3380,Harry Potter,i bet you anything she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.
3381,Ron Weasley,and mrs. norris?
3382,Ron Weasley,i'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror harry.
3383,Harry Potter,the water.
3384,Harry Potter,there was water on the floor that night.
3385,Harry Potter,she only saw the basilisk's reflection.
3386,Harry Potter,'spiders flee before it.'
3387,Harry Potter,it all fits!
3388,Ron Weasley,but how's a basilisk been getting around?
3389,Ron Weasley,a dirty great snake- someone would have seen it.
3390,Harry Potter,hermione's answered that too.
3391,Ron Weasley,pipes?
3392,Ron Weasley,it's using the plumbing!
3393,Harry Potter,remember what aragog said about that girl fifty years ago?
3394,Harry Potter,she died in a bathroom?
3395,Harry Potter,what if she never left?
3396,Ron Weasley,moaning myrtle.
3397,Minerva McGonagall,all students are to return to their house dormitories at once.
3398,Minerva McGonagall,all teachers to the second floor corridor immediately.
3399,Minerva McGonagall,as you can see the heir of slytherin has left another message.
3400,Minerva McGonagall,our worst fear has been realized.
3401,Minerva McGonagall,a student has been taken by the monster into the chamber itself.
3402,Minerva McGonagall,the students must be sent home.
3403,Minerva McGonagall,i'm afraid this is the end of hogwarts.
3404,Gilderoy Lockhart,so sorry- dozed off- what have i missed?
3405,Severus Snape,a girl has been snatched by the monster lockhart.
3406,Severus Snape,your moment has come at last.
3407,Gilderoy Lockhart,my m-moment?
3408,Severus Snape,weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the chamber of secrets is?
3409,Minerva McGonagall,well that's settled.
3410,Minerva McGonagall,we'll leave you to deal with the monster gilderoy.
3411,Minerva McGonagall,your skills after all are a legend.
3412,Gilderoy Lockhart,very well- ah- i'll just be in my office getting umgetting ready.
3413,Poppy Pomfrey,who is it that the monster's taken minerva?
3414,Minerva McGonagall,ginny weasley.
3415,Ron Weasley,'her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever.'
3416,Ron Weasley,ginny…
3417,Harry Potter,lockhart may be useless but he's going to try and get into the chamber.
3418,Harry Potter,at least we can tell him what we know.
3419,Harry Potter,professor we have some information for you!
3420,Harry Potter,are you going somewhere?
3421,Gilderoy Lockhart,uh ah- well yes- um urgent call- unavoidable- got to go.
3422,Ron Weasley,what about my sister?
3424,Gilderoy Lockhart,well um- as to that most unfortunate.
3425,Gilderoy Lockhart,no one regrets more than i.
3426,Ron Weasley,you're the defense against the dark arts teacher!
3427,Ron Weasley,you can't go now!
3428,Gilderoy Lockhart,well- i must say- when i took the job there was nothing in the job description about a…
3429,Harry Potter,you're running away?
3430,Harry Potter,after all that stuff you did in your books?
3431,Gilderoy Lockhart,books can be misleading!
3432,Harry Potter,you wrote them!
3433,Gilderoy Lockhart,my dear boy do use your common sense!
3434,Gilderoy Lockhart,my books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think i'd done all those things!
3435,Harry Potter,you're a fraud!
3436,Harry Potter,you've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!
3437,Ron Weasley,is there anything you can do?
3438,Gilderoy Lockhart,yes now you mention it.
3439,Gilderoy Lockhart,i'm rather gifted with memory charms.
3440,Gilderoy Lockhart,otherwise you see all those wizards would have gone blabbing.
3441,Gilderoy Lockhart,and i'd never have sold another book.
3442,Gilderoy Lockhart,in fact ah…i'm ah…going to have to do the same to you.
3443,Harry Potter,don't even think about it.
3444,Moaning Myrtle,oh!
3445,Moaning Myrtle,who's there?
3446,Moaning Myrtle,oh!
3447,Moaning Myrtle,hello harry!
3448,Moaning Myrtle,ron.
3449,Moaning Myrtle,what do you want?
3450,Harry Potter,to ask you how you died.
3451,Moaning Myrtle,oh!
3452,Moaning Myrtle,it was dreadful.
3453,Moaning Myrtle,it happened right here in this very cubicle.
3454,Moaning Myrtle,i'd hidden because olive hornby was teasing me about my glasses.
3455,Moaning Myrtle,i was crying and then i heard somebody come in.
3456,Harry Potter,who was it myrtle?
3457,Moaning Myrtle,i don't know.
3458,Moaning Myrtle,i was distraught!
3459,Moaning Myrtle,huhh-huh…but they said something funny a kind of made up language.
3460,Moaning Myrtle,and i realized it was a boy speaking so i unlocked the door to tell him to go away and… i died.
3461,Harry Potter,just like that?
3462,Harry Potter,how?
3463,Moaning Myrtle,i just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes…over there by that sink.
3464,Moaning Myrtle,ohhhhooo…
3465,Harry Potter,this is it.
3466,Harry Potter,this is it ron.
3467,Harry Potter,i think this is the entrance to the chamber of secrets.
3468,Ron Weasley,say something.
3469,Ron Weasley,harry say something in parseltongue!
3470,Harry Potter,hesha- hassah.
3471,Gilderoy Lockhart,excellent harry.
3472,Gilderoy Lockhart,haa!
3473,Gilderoy Lockhart,good work!
3474,Gilderoy Lockhart,well then i'll just be ah… there's no need for me to stay.
3475,Harry Potter,oh yes there is!
3476,Harry Potter,you first.
3477,Gilderoy Lockhart,now boys what good will it do?
3478,Ron Weasley,better you than us.
3479,Gilderoy Lockhart,um…but…obviously yes.
3480,Gilderoy Lockhart,sure you don't want to test it first?
3481,Gilderoy Lockhart,no!
3482,Gilderoy Lockhart,aaaah!
3483,Gilderoy Lockhart,it's really quite filthy down here.
3484,Harry Potter,all right.
3485,Harry Potter,let's go.
3486,Moaning Myrtle,oh harry?
3487,Moaning Myrtle,if you die down there you're welcome to share my toilet.
3488,Moaning Myrtle,hee hee.
3489,Harry Potter,uh…thanks myrtle.
3490,Harry Potter,aaah!
3491,Ron Weasley,aaah!
3492,Ron Weasley,ugh!
3493,Harry Potter,now remember any sign of movement close your eyes straightaway.
3494,Ron Weasley,go on.
3495,Harry Potter,this way.
3496,Ron Weasley,what's this?
3497,Gilderoy Lockhart,it looks like a… snake.
3498,Harry Potter,it's a snakeskin.
3499,Ron Weasley,bloody hell.
3500,Ron Weasley,whatever shed this must be sixty feet long-- or more!
3501,Ron Weasley,heart of a lion this one.
3502,Gilderoy Lockhart,the adventure ends here boys.
3503,Gilderoy Lockhart,but don't fret.
3504,Gilderoy Lockhart,the world will know our story.
3505,Gilderoy Lockhart,how i was too late to save the girl.
3506,Gilderoy Lockhart,how you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body.
3507,Gilderoy Lockhart,so you first mr. potter.
3508,Gilderoy Lockhart,say good-bye to your memories.
3509,Gilderoy Lockhart,obliviate!
3510,Ron Weasley,harry!
3511,Ron Weasley,harry!
3512,Harry Potter,ron!
3513,Harry Potter,ron are you ok?
3514,Ron Weasley,i'm fine!
3515,Gilderoy Lockhart,uhh… hello.
3516,Gilderoy Lockhart,who are you?
3517,Ron Weasley,um…ron weasley.
3518,Gilderoy Lockhart,really?
3519,Gilderoy Lockhart,and uh who- who am i?
3520,Ron Weasley,lockhart's memory charm backfired.
3521,Ron Weasley,he hasn't got a clue who he is!
3522,Gilderoy Lockhart,it's an odd sort of place this isn't it?
3523,Gilderoy Lockhart,do you live here?
3524,Ron Weasley,no!
3525,Gilderoy Lockhart,really?
3526,Gilderoy Lockhart,well?
3527,Ron Weasley,what'll do i do now?
3528,Harry Potter,you wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through.
3529,Harry Potter,i'll go on and find ginny!
3530,Ron Weasley,ok.
3531,Harry Potter,hesha- hassah.
3532,Harry Potter,ginny… ginny!
3533,Harry Potter,oh ginny please don't be dead.
3534,Harry Potter,wake up.
3535,Harry Potter,wake up!
3536,Harry Potter,please wake up!
3537,Voldemort,she won't wake.
3538,Harry Potter,tom.
3539,Harry Potter,tom riddle!
3540,Harry Potter,what do you mean 'she won't wake?'
3541,Harry Potter,she's not…?
3542,Voldemort,she's still alive but only just.
3543,Harry Potter,are you a ghost?
3544,Voldemort,a memory preserved in a diary for fifty years.
3545,Harry Potter,she's cold as ice.
3546,Harry Potter,ginny please don't be dead.
3547,Harry Potter,wake up!
3548,Harry Potter,you've got to help me tom.
3549,Harry Potter,there's a basilisk.
3550,Voldemort,it won't come until it's called.
3551,Harry Potter,give me my wand tom.
3552,Voldemort,you won't be needing it.
3553,Harry Potter,listen we've got to go!
3554,Harry Potter,we've got to save her!
3555,Voldemort,i'm afraid i can't do that harry.
3556,Voldemort,you see as poor ginny grows weaker i grow stronger.
3557,Voldemort,yes harry it was ginny weasley who opened the chamber of secrets.
3558,Harry Potter,no.
3559,Harry Potter,she couldn't.
3560,Harry Potter,she wouldn't!
3561,Voldemort,it was ginny who set the basilisk on the mudbloods and filch's cat ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls.
3562,Harry Potter,but why?
3563,Voldemort,because i told her to.
3564,Voldemort,you'll find that i can be very persuasive.
3565,Voldemort,not that she knew what she was doing.
3566,Voldemort,she was shall we say in a kind of trance.
3567,Voldemort,still the power of the diary began to scare her.
3568,Voldemort,and she tried to dispose of it in the girl's bathroom.
3569,Voldemort,and then who should find it but you?
3570,Voldemort,the very person i was most anxious to meet.
3571,Harry Potter,but why did you want to meet me?
3572,Voldemort,i knew i had to talk to you meet you if i could.
3573,Voldemort,so i decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf hagrid to gain your trust.
3574,Harry Potter,hagrid's my friend!
3575,Harry Potter,and you framed him didn't you?
3576,Voldemort,it was my word against hagrid's.
3577,Voldemort,only dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
3578,Harry Potter,i'll bet dumbledore saw right through you.
3579,Voldemort,he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that.
3580,Voldemort,i knew it wouldn't be safe to open the chamber again while i was still at school so i decided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages so that one day i would be able to lead another to finish salazar slytherin's noble work.
3581,Harry Potter,well you haven't finished it this time.
3582,Harry Potter,in a few hours the mandrake draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again.
3583,Voldemort,haven't i told you?
3584,Voldemort,killing mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore.
3585,Voldemort,for many months now my new target… has been you.
3586,Voldemort,how is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?
3587,Voldemort,how did you escape with nothing but a scar while lord voldemort's powers were destroyed?
3588,Harry Potter,why do you care how i escaped?
3589,Harry Potter,voldemort was after your time.
3590,Voldemort,voldemort is my past present and future.
3591,Harry Potter,you!
3592,Harry Potter,you're the heir of slytherin.
3593,Harry Potter,you're voldemort.
3594,Voldemort,surely you didn't think i was going to keep my filthy muggle father's name?
3595,Voldemort,no.
3596,Voldemort,i fashioned myself a new name a name i knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak when i became the greatest sorcerer in the world.
3597,Harry Potter,albus dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
3598,Voldemort,dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!
3599,Harry Potter,he'll never be gone!
3600,Harry Potter,not as long as those who remain are loyal to him!
3601,Harry Potter,fawkes?
3602,Voldemort,so this is what dumbledore sends his great defender a songbird and an old hat.
3603,Voldemort,shearhas- samnathas- sélithaeine.
3604,Voldemort,let's match the power of lord voldemort heir of salazar slytherin against the famous harry potter.
3605,Voldemort,sethae- he- this.
3606,Voldemort,parseltongue won't save you now potter.
3607,Voldemort,it only obeys me!
3608,Voldemort,no!
3609,Voldemort,your bird may have blinded the basilisk but it can still hear you!
3610,Voldemort,yes potter the process is nearly complete.
3611,Voldemort,in a few minutes ginny will be dead and i will cease to be a memory.
3612,Voldemort,lord voldemort will return- very… much… alive!
3613,Harry Potter,ginny-
3614,Voldemort,remarkable isn't it how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body?
3615,Voldemort,i'd guess you have little more than a minute to live.
3616,Voldemort,you'll be with your dear mudblood mother soon harry.
3617,Voldemort,funny the damage a silly little book can do… especially in the hands of a silly little girl.
3618,Voldemort,what are you doing?
3619,Voldemort,stop!
3620,Voldemort,no!
3621,Voldemort,ahhhh!
3622,Voldemort,ahhhh!
3623,Voldemort,ahhhh!
3624,Harry Potter,ginny…
3625,Ginny Weasley,harry.
3626,Ginny Weasley,it was me- but i swear i didn't mean to!
3627,Ginny Weasley,riddle made me and… harry you're hurt!
3628,Harry Potter,don't worry.
3629,Harry Potter,ginny you need to get yourself out.
3630,Harry Potter,follow the chamber and you'll find ron.
3631,Harry Potter,you were brilliant fawkes.
3632,Harry Potter,i just wasn't quick enough… of course!
3633,Harry Potter,phoenix tears have healing powers.
3634,Harry Potter,thanks!
3635,Harry Potter,it's alright ginny.
3636,Harry Potter,it's over.
3637,Harry Potter,it's just a memory.
3638,Gilderoy Lockhart,amazing!
3639,Gilderoy Lockhart,this is just like magic!
3640,Albus Dumbledore,you both realize of course that in the past few hours you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?
3641,Harry Potter,yes sir.
3642,Ron Weasley,yes sir.
3643,Albus Dumbledore,and there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
3644,Harry Potter,yes sir.
3645,Ron Weasley,yes sir.
3646,Albus Dumbledore,therefore it is only fitting that you both receive special awards for services to the school.
3647,Ron Weasley,thanks sir!
3648,Albus Dumbledore,and now mr. weasley if you would have an owl deliver these release papers to azkaban?
3649,Albus Dumbledore,i believe we- we want our gamekeeper back.
3650,Albus Dumbledore,harry… first i want to thank you harry.
3651,Albus Dumbledore,you must have shown me real loyalty down in the chamber.
3652,Albus Dumbledore,nothing but that could have called fawkes to you.
3653,Albus Dumbledore,and um… second i sense that something is troubling you.
3654,Albus Dumbledore,am i right harry?
3655,Harry Potter,it's just… you see sir i- i couldn't help but notice certain things certain- certain similarities between tom riddle and me.
3656,Albus Dumbledore,i see.
3657,Albus Dumbledore,well you can speak parseltongue harry.
3658,Albus Dumbledore,why?
3659,Albus Dumbledore,because lord voldemort can speak parseltongue.
3660,Albus Dumbledore,if i'm not mistaken harry he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.
3661,Harry Potter,voldemort transferred some of his powers… to me?
3662,Albus Dumbledore,not intentionally but yes.
3663,Harry Potter,so the sorting hat was right!
3664,Harry Potter,i should be in slytherin.
3665,Albus Dumbledore,it's true harry.
3666,Albus Dumbledore,you possess many of the qualities that voldemort himself prizes.
3667,Albus Dumbledore,determination resourcefulness and if i may say so a certain disregard for the rules.
3668,Albus Dumbledore,why then did the sorting hat place you in gryffindor?
3669,Harry Potter,because i asked it to.
3670,Albus Dumbledore,exactly harry!
3671,Albus Dumbledore,exactly!
3672,Albus Dumbledore,which makes you different from voldemort.
3673,Albus Dumbledore,it is not our abilities that show what we truly are.
3674,Albus Dumbledore,it is our choices.
3675,Albus Dumbledore,if you want proof why you belong in gryffindor then i suggest that you look more closely at this.
3676,Albus Dumbledore,be careful.
3677,Harry Potter,godric gryffindor.
3678,Albus Dumbledore,ah- it would take a true gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
3679,Harry Potter,dobby!
3680,Harry Potter,so this is your master!
3681,Harry Potter,the family you serve is the malfoys
3682,Dobby,um-humm…
3683,Lucius Malfoy,i'll deal with you later.
3684,Lucius Malfoy,out of my way potter!
3685,Lucius Malfoy,so it's true-- you have returned!
3686,Albus Dumbledore,when the governors learned that arthur weasley's daughter was taken into the chamber they saw fit to summon me back.
3687,Lucius Malfoy,ridiculous!
3688,Albus Dumbledore,curiously lucius several of them were under the impression that you would curse their families if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place.
3689,Lucius Malfoy,how dare you?
3691,Albus Dumbledore,i beg your pardon?
3692,Lucius Malfoy,my sole concern has always been and will always be the welfare of this school and of course its students.
3693,Lucius Malfoy,the culprit has been identified i presume?
3694,Albus Dumbledore,oh yes.
3695,Lucius Malfoy,and?
3696,Lucius Malfoy,who was it?
3697,Albus Dumbledore,voldemort.
3698,Lucius Malfoy,ah!
3699,Albus Dumbledore,only this time he chose to act through somebody else by means of this.
3700,Lucius Malfoy,i see.
3701,Albus Dumbledore,fortunately our young mr. potter discovered it.
3702,Albus Dumbledore,one hopes that no more of lord voldemort's old school things should find their way into innocent hands.
3703,Albus Dumbledore,the consequences for the one responsible would be severe.
3704,Lucius Malfoy,well let us hope that mr. potter will always be around to save the day.
3705,Harry Potter,don't worry.
3706,Harry Potter,i will be.
3707,Lucius Malfoy,dumbledore.
3708,Lucius Malfoy,come dobby.
3709,Lucius Malfoy,we're leaving.
3710,Dobby,ahh!
3711,Dobby,oow!
3712,Harry Potter,sir i wonder if i could have that?
3713,Harry Potter,mr. malfoy!
3714,Harry Potter,mr. malfoy!
3715,Harry Potter,i have something of yours.
3716,Lucius Malfoy,mine?
3717,Lucius Malfoy,i don't know what you're talking about.
3718,Harry Potter,oh i think you do sir.
3719,Harry Potter,i think you slipped the diary into ginny weasley's cauldron that day at diagon alley.
3720,Lucius Malfoy,you do do you?
3721,Lucius Malfoy,why don't you prove it?
3722,Lucius Malfoy,come dobby.
3723,Lucius Malfoy,dobby!
3724,Harry Potter,open it.
3725,Lucius Malfoy,dobby?
3726,Dobby,master has given dobby a sock!
3727,Lucius Malfoy,what?
3728,Lucius Malfoy,i didn't give.
3729,Dobby,master has presented dobby with clothes!
3730,Dobby,dobby is free!
3731,Lucius Malfoy,you've lost me my servant!
3732,Dobby,you shall not harm harry potter!
3733,Lucius Malfoy,advada.
3734,Lucius Malfoy,your parents were meddlesome fools too.
3735,Lucius Malfoy,you mark my words potter one day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end!
3736,Dobby,harry potter freed dobby!
3737,Dobby,how can dobby ever repay him?
3738,Harry Potter,just promise me something.
3739,Dobby,anything sir!
3740,Harry Potter,never try to save my life again.
3741,Other,welcome back sir nicholas!
3742,Nearly Headless Nick,thank you!
3743,Other,good evening sir nicholas!
3744,Nearly Headless Nick,good evening!

3753,Hermione Granger,it's good to be back!
3754,Hermione Granger,congratulations!
3755,Hermione Granger,i can't believe you solved it!
3756,Harry Potter,well we had loads of help from you.
3757,Harry Potter,we couldn't have done it without you.
3758,Hermione Granger,thanks.
3759,Minerva McGonagall,could i have your attention please?
3760,Albus Dumbledore,before we begin the feast let us have a round of applause for professor sprout and madame pomfrey whose mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been petrified.
3761,Albus Dumbledore,also in light of the recent events as a school treat all exams have been canceled.
3762,Hermione Granger,oh no!
3763,Rubeus Hagrid,sorry i'm late!
3764,Rubeus Hagrid,the owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused.
3765,Rubeus Hagrid,some ruddy bird called errol.
3766,Rubeus Hagrid,and i'd just like to say that aif it hadn't been for you harry and ron and hermione o' course i woulduh- i'd still be you-know-where so i- i'd just like to say 'thanks.'

3952,Cornelius Fudge,as minister for magic it is my duty to inform you mr. potter... that earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located... a little south of sheffield circling a chimney stack.
3953,Cornelius Fudge,the accidental magic reversal department was dispatched immediately.
3954,Cornelius Fudge,she has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
3955,Cornelius Fudge,she will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.

3965,Cornelius Fudge,come now harry the ministry doesn't send people to azkaban... for blowing up their aunts.
3966,Cornelius Fudge,on the other hand running away like that given the state of things... was very very irresponsible.

3969,Harry Potter,sirius black you mean?
3970,Harry Potter,but what's he got to do with me?

4037,Arthur Weasley,looking forward to a new term?
4038,Harry Potter,yeah.
4039,Harry Potter,it should be great.
4040,Arthur Weasley,harry some within the ministry would strongly discourage me... from divulging what i'm about to reveal to you.
4041,Arthur Weasley,but i think that you need to know the facts.
4042,Arthur Weasley,you are in danger.
4043,Arthur Weasley,grave danger.
4044,Harry Potter,has this anything to do with sirius black sir?
4045,Arthur Weasley,what do you know about sirius black harry?
4046,Harry Potter,only that he's escaped from azkaban.
4047,Arthur Weasley,do you know why?
4048,Arthur Weasley,thirteen years ago when you stopped...
4049,Harry Potter,voldemort.
4050,Arthur Weasley,don't say his name.
4051,Harry Potter,sorry.
4052,Arthur Weasley,when you stopped you-know-who... black lost everything.
4053,Arthur Weasley,but to this day he still remains a faithful servant.
4054,Arthur Weasley,and in his mind... you are the only thing that stands in the way... of you-know-who returning to power.
4055,Arthur Weasley,and that is why... he has escaped from azkaban.
4056,Arthur Weasley,to find you.
4057,Harry Potter,and kill me.
4058,Arthur Weasley,harry swear to me that whatever you might hear... you won't go looking for black.
4059,Harry Potter,mr. weasley... why would i go looking for someone who wants to kill me?

4067,Ron Weasley,brilliant.
4068,Hermione Granger,honestly ron it's not funny.
4069,Hermione Granger,harry was lucky not to be expelled.
4070,Harry Potter,i think i was lucky not to be arrested actually.
4071,Ron Weasley,i still think it was brilliant.
4072,Hermione Granger,come on.
4073,Hermione Granger,everywhere else is full.
4074,Ron Weasley,who do you think that is?
4075,Hermione Granger,professor r.j. lupin.
4076,Ron Weasley,do you know everything?
4077,Ron Weasley,how is it she knows everything?
4078,Hermione Granger,it's on his suitcase ronald.
4079,Ron Weasley,oh.
4080,Harry Potter,do you think he's really asleep?
4081,Hermione Granger,seems to be.
4082,Hermione Granger,why?
4083,Harry Potter,i gotta tell you something.
4084,Ron Weasley,let me get this straight.
4085,Ron Weasley,sirius black has escaped from azkaban to come after you?
4086,Harry Potter,yeah.
4087,Hermione Granger,but they'll catch black won't they?
4088,Hermione Granger,i mean everyone's looking for him.
4089,Ron Weasley,sure.
4090,Ron Weasley,except no one's ever broken out of azkaban before... and he's a murderous raving lunatic.
4091,Harry Potter,thanks ron.
4092,Hermione Granger,why are we stopping?
4093,Hermione Granger,we can't be there yet.
4094,Ron Weasley,what's going on?
4095,Harry Potter,i don't know.
4096,Harry Potter,maybe we've broken down.
4097,Hermione Granger,ouch ron.
4098,Hermione Granger,that was my foot.
4099,Ron Weasley,there's something moving out there.
4100,Ron Weasley,i think... someone's coming aboard.
4101,Ron Weasley,bloody hell!
4102,Ron Weasley,what's happening?
4103,Hermione Granger,harry.
4104,Hermione Granger,harry are you all right?
4105,Harry Potter,thank you.
4106,Remus Lupin,here eat this.
4107,Remus Lupin,it'll help.
4108,Remus Lupin,it's all right.
4109,Remus Lupin,it's chocolate.
4110,Harry Potter,what was that thing that came?
4111,Remus Lupin,it was a dementor.
4112,Remus Lupin,one of the guards of azkaban.
4113,Remus Lupin,it's gone now.
4114,Remus Lupin,it was searching the train for sirius black.
4115,Remus Lupin,if you'll excuse me i need to have a little word with the driver.
4116,Remus Lupin,eat.
4117,Remus Lupin,you'll feel better.
4118,Harry Potter,what happened to me?
4119,Ron Weasley,well you sort of went rigid.
4120,Ron Weasley,we thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
4121,Harry Potter,and did either of you two... you know... pass out?
4122,Ron Weasley,no.
4123,Ron Weasley,i felt weird though.
4124,Ron Weasley,like i'd never be cheerful again.
4125,Harry Potter,but someone was screaming.
4126,Harry Potter,a woman.
4127,Hermione Granger,no one was screaming harry.
4128,Albus Dumbledore,welcome!
4129,Albus Dumbledore,welcome to another year at hogwarts!
4130,Albus Dumbledore,now i'd like to say a few words... before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
4131,Albus Dumbledore,first i'm pleased to welcome professor r.j. lupin... who's kindly consented to fill the post... of defense against the dark arts teacher.
4132,Albus Dumbledore,good luck professor.
4133,Hermione Granger,of course.
4134,Hermione Granger,that's why he knew to give you the chocolate harry.
4135,Draco Malfoy,potter.
4136,Draco Malfoy,is it true you fainted?
4137,Draco Malfoy,i mean you actually fainted?
4138,Ron Weasley,shove off malfoy.
4139,Harry Potter,how did he find out?
4140,Hermione Granger,just forget it.
4141,Albus Dumbledore,our care of magical creatures teacher... has decided to retire... in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
4142,Albus Dumbledore,fortunately i'm delighted to announce... that his place will be taken by none other... than our own rubeus hagrid.
4143,Albus Dumbledore,finally on a more disquieting note... at the request of the ministry of magic... hogwarts will until further notice play host to the dementors of azkaban... until such a time as sirius black is captured.
4144,Albus Dumbledore,the dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
4145,Albus Dumbledore,now whilst i've been assured... that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities... a word of caution.
4146,Albus Dumbledore,dementors are vicious creatures.
4147,Albus Dumbledore,they'll not distinguish... between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
4148,Albus Dumbledore,therefore i must warn each and every one of you... to give them no reason to harm you.
4149,Albus Dumbledore,it is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
4150,Albus Dumbledore,but you know happiness can be found... even in the darkest of times... if one only remembers to turn on the light.
4151,Seamus Finnigan,fortuna major.
4152,Seamus Finnigan,here listen.

4194,Sybill Trelawney,in this room you shall discover if you possess the sight.

4197,Sybill Trelawney,together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
4198,Sybill Trelawney,this term we'll focus on tasseomancy the art of reading tea leaves.
4199,Sybill Trelawney,so please take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
4200,Sybill Trelawney,what do you see?
4201,Sybill Trelawney,the truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book waiting to be read.
4202,Sybill Trelawney,but first you must broaden your minds.
4203,Sybill Trelawney,first you must look beyond.
4204,Hermione Granger,what a load of rubbish.
4205,Ron Weasley,where did you come from?
4206,Hermione Granger,me?
4207,Hermione Granger,i've been here all this time.
4208,Sybill Trelawney,you boy... is your grandmother quite well?

4219,Sybill Trelawney,tell me what you see.
4220,Ron Weasley,oh yeah.
4221,Ron Weasley,um... well harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
4222,Ron Weasley,that's trials and suffering.
4223,Ron Weasley,and that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
4224,Ron Weasley,so... you're gonna suffer but you're gonna be... happy about it.
4225,Sybill Trelawney,give me the cup.
4226,Sybill Trelawney,oh my dear boy.

4231,Other,the grim.
4232,Other,taking form of a giant spectral dog.
4233,Other,it's among the darkest omens in our world.
4234,Other,it's an omen... of death.
4235,Ron Weasley,you don't think that grim thing's got anything to do with sirius black?
4236,Hermione Granger,oh honestly ron.
4237,Hermione Granger,if you ask me divination's a woolly discipline.
4238,Hermione Granger,now ancient runes that's a fascinating subject.
4239,Ron Weasley,ancient runes?
4240,Ron Weasley,exactly how many classes are you taking?
4241,Hermione Granger,a fair few.
4242,Ron Weasley,hang on.
4243,Ron Weasley,that's not possible.
4244,Ron Weasley,ancient runes is in the same time as divination.
4245,Ron Weasley,you have to be in two classes at once.
4246,Hermione Granger,don't be silly ron.
4247,Hermione Granger,how could anyone be in two classes at once?
4248,Hermione Granger,broaden your minds.

4281,Ron Weasley,hagrid exactly what is that?
4282,Rubeus Hagrid,that ron is a hippogriff.
4283,Rubeus Hagrid,first thing you wanna know about hippogriffs is that they're very proud creatures.
4284,Rubeus Hagrid,very easily offended.
4285,Rubeus Hagrid,you do not want to insult a hippogriff.
4286,Rubeus Hagrid,it may just be the last thing you ever do.

4340,Draco Malfoy,it's killed me!
4341,Rubeus Hagrid,calm down!
4342,Rubeus Hagrid,it's just a scratch!
4343,Hermione Granger,hagrid!
4344,Hermione Granger,he has to be taken to the hospital.
4345,Rubeus Hagrid,i'm the teacher.
4346,Rubeus Hagrid,i'll do it.
4347,Draco Malfoy,oh you're gonna regret this.
4348,Rubeus Hagrid,class dismissed!
4349,Draco Malfoy,you and your bloody chicken!
4350,Pansy Parkinson,does it hurt terribly draco?
4351,Draco Malfoy,it comes and it goes.
4352,Draco Malfoy,still i consider myself lucky.
4353,Draco Malfoy,madam pomfrey said another minute and i could've lost my arm.
4354,Draco Malfoy,i couldn't do homework for weeks.
4355,Ron Weasley,listen to the idiot.
4356,Ron Weasley,he's really laying it on thick isn't he?
4357,Harry Potter,at least hagrid didn't get fired.
4358,Hermione Granger,yeah but i heard draco's father's furious.
4359,Hermione Granger,we haven't heard the end of this.
4360,Seamus Finnigan,he's been sighted!
4361,Seamus Finnigan,he's been sighted!
4362,Ron Weasley,who?
4363,Seamus Finnigan,sirius black!
4364,Hermione Granger,dufftown?
4365,Hermione Granger,that's not far from here.
4366,Other,you don't think he'd come to hogwarts do you?
4367,Other,with dementors at every entrance?
4368,Seamus Finnigan,dementors?
4369,Seamus Finnigan,he's already slipped past them once.
4370,Seamus Finnigan,who's to say he won't do it again?
4371,Other,that's right.
4372,Other,black could be anywhere.
4373,Other,it's like trying to catch smoke.
4374,Other,like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
4375,Remus Lupin,intriguing isn't it?
4376,Remus Lupin,would anyone like to venture a guess... as to what is inside?
4377,Dean Thomas,that's a boggart that is.
4378,Remus Lupin,very good mr. thomas.
4379,Remus Lupin,now can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
4380,Hermione Granger,no one knows.
4381,Ron Weasley,when did she get here?
4382,Hermione Granger,boggarts are shape-shifters.
4383,Hermione Granger,they take the shape of whatever a particular person fears the most.
4384,Hermione Granger,that's what makes them so...
4385,Remus Lupin,so terrifying yes yes yes... luckily a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
4386,Remus Lupin,let's practice it now.
4387,Remus Lupin,without wands please.
4388,Remus Lupin,after me.
4389,Remus Lupin,riddikulus!
4390,All,riddikulus!
4391,Remus Lupin,very good.
4392,Remus Lupin,a little louder and very clear.
4393,Remus Lupin,listen: riddikulus!
4394,All,riddikulus!
4395,Draco Malfoy,this class is ridiculous.
4396,Remus Lupin,very good.
4397,Remus Lupin,so much for the easy part.
4398,Remus Lupin,you see the incantation alone is not enough.
4399,Remus Lupin,what really finishes a boggart is laughter.
4400,Remus Lupin,you need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
4401,Remus Lupin,let me explain.
4402,Remus Lupin,uh... neville would you join me please?
4403,Remus Lupin,come on don't be shy.
4404,Remus Lupin,come on.
4405,Remus Lupin,come on.
4406,Remus Lupin,hello.
4407,Remus Lupin,neville what frightens you most of all?
4408,Neville Longbottom,professor snape.
4409,Remus Lupin,sorry?
4410,Neville Longbottom,professor snape.
4411,Remus Lupin,professor snape.
4412,Remus Lupin,yes frightens all.
4413,Remus Lupin,and i believe you live with your grandmother.
4414,Neville Longbottom,y-yes but i don't want that boggart to turn into her either.
4415,Remus Lupin,no... it won't.
4416,Remus Lupin,i want you to picture her clothes.
4417,Remus Lupin,only her clothes very clearly in your mind.
4418,Neville Longbottom,she carries a red handbag...
4419,Remus Lupin,we don't need to hear.
4420,Remus Lupin,as long as you see it we'll see it.
4421,Remus Lupin,now when i open that wardrobe... here's what i want you to do.
4422,Remus Lupin,excuse me.
4423,Remus Lupin,imagine professor snape in your grandmother's clothes.
4424,Remus Lupin,can you do that?
4425,Remus Lupin,yes.
4426,Remus Lupin,wand at the ready.
4427,Remus Lupin,one two three.
4428,Remus Lupin,think neville think.
4429,Neville Longbottom,riddikulus!
4430,Remus Lupin,wonderful neville wonderful!
4431,Remus Lupin,incredible!
4432,Remus Lupin,okay... to the back neville.
4433,Remus Lupin,everyone form a line!
4434,Remus Lupin,form a line!
4435,Remus Lupin,i want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most... and turn it into something funny.
4436,Remus Lupin,next!
4437,Remus Lupin,ron!
4438,Remus Lupin,concentrate.
4439,Remus Lupin,face your fear.
4440,Remus Lupin,be brave!
4441,Remus Lupin,wand at the ready ron wand at the ready.
4442,Ron Weasley,riddikulus!
4443,Remus Lupin,yes!
4444,Remus Lupin,you see?
4445,Remus Lupin,very good very good!
4446,Remus Lupin,marvelous!
4447,Remus Lupin,absolutely very very enjoyable!
4448,Remus Lupin,parvati!
4449,Remus Lupin,next!
4450,Remus Lupin,show us what you see.
4451,Remus Lupin,keep your nerve.
4452,Remus Lupin,steady.
4453,Parvati Patil,riddikulus!
4454,Remus Lupin,and next!
4455,Remus Lupin,step up step up!
4456,Remus Lupin,wonderful wonderful!
4457,Remus Lupin,here!
4458,Remus Lupin,riddikulus!
4459,Remus Lupin,right.
4460,Remus Lupin,sorry about that.
4461,Remus Lupin,that's enough for today.
4462,Remus Lupin,collect your books from the back.
4463,Remus Lupin,that's the end of the lesson.
4464,Remus Lupin,thank you!
4465,Remus Lupin,sorry!
4466,Remus Lupin,sorry you can have too much of a good thing.
4467,Minerva McGonagall,now remember these visits to hogsmeade village are a privilege.
4468,Minerva McGonagall,should your behavior reflect poorly on the school in anyway that privilege shall not be extended again.
4469,Minerva McGonagall,no permission form signed no visiting the village.
4470,Minerva McGonagall,that's the rule potter.
4471,Argus Filch,those with permission follow me.
4472,Argus Filch,those without stay put.
4473,Harry Potter,but professor i thought if you signed it then i could...
4474,Minerva McGonagall,i can't.
4475,Minerva McGonagall,only a parent or a guardian can sign.
4476,Minerva McGonagall,since i am neither it would be inappropriate.
4477,Minerva McGonagall,i'm sorry potter.
4478,Minerva McGonagall,that's my final word.
4479,Harry Potter,forget about it guys.
4480,Harry Potter,see you later.
4481,Harry Potter,professor can i ask you something?
4482,Remus Lupin,you want to know why i stopped you facing that boggart yes?
4483,Remus Lupin,i would've thought it'd be obvious.
4484,Remus Lupin,i assumed it would take the shape of lord voldemort.
4485,Harry Potter,i did think of voldemort at first.
4486,Harry Potter,but then i remembered that night on the train... and the dementor.
4487,Remus Lupin,i'm very impressed.
4488,Remus Lupin,that suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
4489,Remus Lupin,this is very wise.
4490,Harry Potter,before i fainted... i heard something.
4491,Harry Potter,a woman... screaming.
4492,Remus Lupin,dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
4493,Remus Lupin,our pain becomes their power.
4494,Harry Potter,i think it was my mother... the night she was murdered.
4495,Remus Lupin,the very first time i saw you harry i recognized you immediately.
4496,Remus Lupin,not by your scar by your eyes.
4497,Remus Lupin,they're your mother lily's.
4498,Remus Lupin,yes.
4499,Remus Lupin,oh yes.
4500,Remus Lupin,i knew her.
4501,Remus Lupin,your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
4502,Remus Lupin,not only was she a singularly gifted witch... she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
4503,Remus Lupin,she had a way of seeing the beauty in others... even and perhaps most especially when that person could not see it in themselves.
4504,Remus Lupin,and your father james on the other hand... he... he had a certain shall we say talent for trouble.
4505,Remus Lupin,a talent rumor has it he passed on to you.
4506,Remus Lupin,you're more like them than you know harry.
4507,Remus Lupin,in time you'll come to see just how much.
4508,Ron Weasley,honeyduke's sweetshop is brilliant but nothing beats zonko's joke shop.
4509,Ron Weasley,we never did got a chance to go to the shrieking shack though.
4510,Ron Weasley,you heard it's the most...
4511,Harry Potter,the most haunted building in britain.
4512,Harry Potter,yeah i know.
4513,Harry Potter,what's going on?
4514,Ron Weasley,probably neville forgotten the password again.
4515,Neville Longbottom,hey!.
4516,Ron Weasley,oh you're there.
4517,Percy Weasley,let me through please.
4518,Percy Weasley,excuse me!
4519,Percy Weasley,i'm head boy!
4520,Percy Weasley,get back all of you.
4521,Percy Weasley,no one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
4522,Ginny Weasley,the fat lady!
4523,Ginny Weasley,she's gone!
4524,Ron Weasley,serves her right.
4525,Ron Weasley,she was a terrible singer.
4526,Hermione Granger,it's not funny ron.
4527,Percy Weasley,keep calm everyone.
4528,Percy Weasley,break into fours.
4529,Percy Weasley,back to your common room.
4530,Percy Weasley,be quiet.
4531,Albus Dumbledore,make way.
4532,Percy Weasley,the headmaster's here.
4533,Albus Dumbledore,come on move.
4534,Percy Weasley,you heard.
4535,Percy Weasley,move!
4536,Albus Dumbledore,mr. filch?
4537,Albus Dumbledore,round up the ghosts.
4538,Albus Dumbledore,tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the fat lady.
4539,Argus Filch,there's no need for ghosts professor.
4540,Argus Filch,the fat lady's there.
4541,Percy Weasley,mind where you're going!
4542,Percy Weasley,slow down!
4543,Percy Weasley,you listen!
4544,Percy Weasley,i'm head boy!
4545,Percy Weasley,come back here!
4546,Albus Dumbledore,keep moving!
4547,Albus Dumbledore,dear lady who did this to you?
4548,The Fat Lady,eyes like the devil he's got and a soul as dark as his name.
4549,The Fat Lady,it's him headmaster.
4550,The Fat Lady,the one they all talk about.
4551,The Fat Lady,he's here somewhere in the castle!
4552,The Fat Lady,sirius black!
4553,Albus Dumbledore,secure the castle mr. filch.
4554,Albus Dumbledore,the rest of you to the great hall.
4555,Argus Filch,i've searched the astronomy tower and the owlery sir.
4556,Argus Filch,but there's nothing there.
4557,Albus Dumbledore,ah thank you.
4558,Filius Flitwick,the third floor's clear too sir.
4559,Albus Dumbledore,very good.
4560,Severus Snape,i've done the dungeons headmaster.
4561,Severus Snape,no sign of black nor anywhere else in the castle.
4562,Albus Dumbledore,i didn't really expect him to linger.
4563,Severus Snape,remarkable feat don't you think?
4564,Severus Snape,to enter hogwarts castle on one's own... completely undetected?
4565,Albus Dumbledore,quite remarkable yes.
4566,Severus Snape,any theories on how he managed it?
4567,Albus Dumbledore,many.
4568,Albus Dumbledore,each as unlikely as the next.
4569,Severus Snape,you may recall... prior to the start of term i expressed concerns... about your appointment of professor...
4570,Albus Dumbledore,not a single professor inside this castle would help sirius black enter it.
4571,Albus Dumbledore,i'm quite convinced the castle is safe... and i'm more than willing to send the students back to their houses.
4572,Severus Snape,what about potter?
4573,Severus Snape,should he be warned?
4574,Albus Dumbledore,perhaps.
4575,Albus Dumbledore,but for now let him sleep.
4576,Albus Dumbledore,for in dreams we enter a world that's entirely our own.
4577,Albus Dumbledore,let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
4578,Severus Snape,turn to page 394.
4579,Harry Potter,excuse me sir.
4580,Harry Potter,where's professor lupin?
4581,Severus Snape,that's not really your concern is it potter?
4582,Severus Snape,suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching... at the present time.
4583,Severus Snape,turn to page 394.
4584,Ron Weasley,werewolves?
4585,Hermione Granger,but sir we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
4586,Hermione Granger,we're not meant to start that for weeks.
4587,Severus Snape,quiet.
4588,Ron Weasley,when did she come in?
4589,Ron Weasley,did you see her come in?
4590,Severus Snape,now which one of you can tell me the difference... between an animagus and a werewolf?
4591,Severus Snape,no one?
4592,Severus Snape,how disappointing.
4593,Hermione Granger,please sir.
4594,Hermione Granger,an animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
4595,Hermione Granger,a werewolf has no choice.
4596,Hermione Granger,with each full moon when he transforms he no longer remembers who he is.
4597,Hermione Granger,he'd kill his best friend if he crossed his path.
4598,Hermione Granger,furthermore the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
4599,Severus Snape,thank you mr. malfoy.
4600,Severus Snape,that's the second time... you've spoken out of turn miss granger.
4601,Severus Snape,are you incapable of restraining yourself... or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
4602,Ron Weasley,he's got a point you know.
4603,Severus Snape,five points from gryffindor.
4604,Severus Snape,as an antidote to your ignorance and on my desk by monday morning... two rolls of parchment on the werewolf with emphasis... on recognizing it.
4605,Harry Potter,sir it's quidditch tomorrow.
4606,Severus Snape,then i suggest you take extra care mr. potter.
4607,Severus Snape,loss of limb will not excuse you.
4608,Severus Snape,page 394. the term werewolf... is a contraction of the anglo-saxon word were... which means man and wolf.
4609,Severus Snape,werewolf man-wolf.
4610,Severus Snape,there are several ways to become a werewolf.
4611,Severus Snape,they include being given the power of shape-shifting... being bitten by a werewolf...
4612,Hermione Granger,go harry!
4613,Hermione Granger,go harry!
4614,Albus Dumbledore,arresto momentum!
4615,Ron Weasley,he looks a bit peaky doesn't he?
4616,Fred Weasley,peaky?
4617,Fred Weasley,what do you expect?
4618,Fred Weasley,he fell over 100 feet.
4619,George Weasley,yeah come on ron let's walk you off the astronomy tower and see what you look like.
4620,Harry Potter,probably a right sight better than he normally does.
4621,Hermione Granger,how are you feeling?
4622,Harry Potter,oh brilliant.
4623,Fred Weasley,you gave us a right good scare there mate.
4624,Harry Potter,what happened?
4625,Ron Weasley,well you fell off your broom.
4626,Harry Potter,really?
4627,Harry Potter,i meant the match.
4628,Harry Potter,who won?
4629,Hermione Granger,umm... no one blames you harry.
4630,Hermione Granger,the dementors aren't supposed to come inside the grounds.
4631,Hermione Granger,dumbledore's furious.
4632,Hermione Granger,as soon as he saved you he sent them off.
4633,Ron Weasley,there's something else you should know too.
4634,Ron Weasley,when you fell your broom sort of blew into the whomping willow and... well...
4635,Remus Lupin,i'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
4636,Remus Lupin,is there no chance of fixing it?
4637,Harry Potter,no.
4638,Harry Potter,professor why do the dementors affect me so?
4639,Harry Potter,i mean more than everyone else?
4640,Remus Lupin,listen.
4641,Remus Lupin,dementors are amongst the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
4642,Remus Lupin,they feed on every good feeling every happy memory... until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
4643,Remus Lupin,you are not weak harry.
4644,Remus Lupin,the dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
4645,Remus Lupin,horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
4646,Remus Lupin,you have nothing to be ashamed of.
4647,Harry Potter,i'm scared professor.
4648,Remus Lupin,well i'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
4649,Harry Potter,i need to know how to fight them.
4650,Harry Potter,you could teach me.
4651,Harry Potter,you made that dementor on the train go away.
4652,Remus Lupin,there was only one that night.
4653,Harry Potter,but you made it go away.
4654,Remus Lupin,i don't pretend to be an expert harry.
4655,Remus Lupin,but as the dementors seem to have developed a particular interest in you... perhaps i should teach you.
4656,Remus Lupin,but after the holidays.
4657,Remus Lupin,for now i need to rest.
4658,Argus Filch,last call for hogsmeade!
4659,Argus Filch,come on now!
4660,Harry Potter,guys let me go.
4661,Fred Weasley,clever harry.
4662,George Weasley,but not clever enough.
4663,George Weasley,besides we've got a better way.
4664,Harry Potter,i'm trying to get to hogsmeade.

4743,Ron Weasley,shut your mouth malfoy.
4744,Draco Malfoy,uh not very friendly.

4746,Hermione Granger,hope you don't mean yourself!
4747,Draco Malfoy,how dare you talk to me!
4748,Draco Malfoy,you filthy little mudblood!
4749,Draco Malfoy,who is that?

4762,Ron Weasley,that was not funny.
4763,Ron Weasley,those weasels!
4764,Ron Weasley,never told me about any marauder's map.
4765,Hermione Granger,but harry isn't going to keep it.
4766,Hermione Granger,he's going to turn it over to professor mcgonagall.
4767,Hermione Granger,aren't you?
4768,Ron Weasley,sure.
4769,Ron Weasley,along with his invisibility cloak.
4770,Hermione Granger,oh look who it is.
4771,Hermione Granger,madam rosmerta.
4772,Hermione Granger,ron fancies her.
4773,Ron Weasley,that's not true!
4774,Cornelius Fudge,professor mcgonagall!
4775,Minerva McGonagall,cornelius!
4776,Rubeus Hagrid,allow me minister.
4777,Cornelius Fudge,oh hagrid...
4778,Rubeus Hagrid,sorry about that.
4779,Cornelius Fudge,rosmerta my dear.
4780,Cornelius Fudge,i hope business is good.
4781,Rosmerta,it'd be a lot better if the ministry wasn't sending dementors... into my pub every other night!
4782,Cornelius Fudge,we have... we have a killer on the loose!
4783,Rosmerta,sirius black in hogsmeade!
4784,Rosmerta,and what would bring him here?
4785,Cornelius Fudge,harry potter.
4786,Rosmerta,harry potter?
4787,Cornelius Fudge,come.
4788,Hermione Granger,harry!
4789,Shrunken head,no underage wizards allowed in today!
4790,Shrunken head,shut the damn door!
4791,Hermione Granger,so rude.
4792,Ron Weasley,thick heads.
4793,Shrunken head,thick heads?!
4794,Shrunken head,how dare they!
4795,Shrunken head,who are they calling thick heads?
4796,Shrunken head,young whippersnappers!
4797,Rosmerta,nobody's going to come to a pub where they're gonna get scared out of their wits.
4798,Rosmerta,why?
4799,Minerva McGonagall,professor dumbledore does not want dementors around the place i can assure you.
4800,Rosmerta,now tell me what this is all about.
4801,Minerva McGonagall,well.
4802,Minerva McGonagall,now years ago when harry potter's parents realized they were marked for death... you remember?
4803,Minerva McGonagall,they went into hiding.
4804,Minerva McGonagall,few knew where they were.
4805,Minerva McGonagall,one who did was sirius black.
4806,Minerva McGonagall,and he told you-know-who!
4807,Cornelius Fudge,not only did black lead you-know-who to the potters that night but he also killed one of their friends peter pettigrew!
4808,Rosmerta,peter pettigrew?
4809,Minerva McGonagall,yes little lump of a boy.
4810,Minerva McGonagall,always trailing after sirius black.
4811,Rosmerta,ah i remember him.
4812,Rosmerta,never let james and sirius out of his sight.
4813,Rosmerta,but what happened?
4814,Minerva McGonagall,well peter pettigrew tried to warn the potters... and might have managed to had he not run into an old friend sirius black.
4815,Cornelius Fudge,black was vicious.
4816,Cornelius Fudge,he didn't kill pettigrew.
4817,Cornelius Fudge,he destroyed him!
4818,Cornelius Fudge,a finger.
4819,Cornelius Fudge,that's all that was left.
4820,Cornelius Fudge,a finger.
4821,Cornelius Fudge,nothing else.
4822,Minerva McGonagall,yes.
4823,Minerva McGonagall,sirius black may not have put his hands to the potters but he's the reason they're dead.
4824,Cornelius Fudge,and now he wants to finish what he started.
4825,Minerva McGonagall,mhmm.
4826,Rosmerta,i don't believe it.
4827,Cornelius Fudge,ah that's not the worst of it.
4828,Rosmerta,what could be worse?
4829,Minerva McGonagall,this: sirius black was... and remains to this day... harry potter's godfather!
4830,Hermione Granger,ron look!
4831,Hermione Granger,sorry sorry.
4832,Hermione Granger,excuse me excuse me sorry.
4833,Hermione Granger,harry what happened?
4834,Harry Potter,he was their friend... and he betrayed them.
4835,Harry Potter,he was their friend!
4836,Harry Potter,i hope he finds me.
4837,Harry Potter,because when he does i'm gonna be ready!
4838,Harry Potter,when he does i'm gonna kill him!
4839,Remus Lupin,harry.
4840,Remus Lupin,there you are.
4841,Remus Lupin,you came.
4842,Remus Lupin,are you sure about this harry?
4843,Remus Lupin,you know this is very advanced magic well beyond the ordinary wizarding level.
4844,Harry Potter,i'm sure.
4845,Remus Lupin,well everything's prepared.
4846,Remus Lupin,now the spell i'm going to try to teach you is called the patronus charm.
4847,Remus Lupin,did you ever hear of it?
4848,Remus Lupin,no?
4849,Remus Lupin,well... a patronus is a kind of positive force.
4850,Remus Lupin,for the wizard who conjures one... it works something like a shield with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
4851,Remus Lupin,but in order for it to work you need to think of a memory.
4852,Remus Lupin,not just any memory a very happy memory a very powerful memory.
4853,Remus Lupin,can you do this?
4854,Remus Lupin,yes.
4855,Remus Lupin,very well.
4856,Remus Lupin,close your eyes.
4857,Remus Lupin,concentrate.
4858,Remus Lupin,explore your past.
4859,Remus Lupin,do you have a memory?
4860,Remus Lupin,allow it to fill you up.
4861,Remus Lupin,lose yourself within it.
4862,Remus Lupin,then speak the incantation expecto patronum.
4863,Harry Potter,expecto patronum.
4864,Remus Lupin,very good.
4865,Remus Lupin,shall we?
4866,Remus Lupin,wand at the ready.
4867,Harry Potter,expecto patronum!
4868,Harry Potter,expecto... expecto... expect...
4869,Remus Lupin,here we go.
4870,Remus Lupin,come on.
4871,Remus Lupin,sit up.
4872,Remus Lupin,deep breaths.
4873,Remus Lupin,it's all right.
4874,Remus Lupin,i didn't expect you to do it the first time.
4875,Remus Lupin,that would have been remarkable.
4876,Remus Lupin,here eat this.
4877,Remus Lupin,you'll feel better.
4878,Harry Potter,that's one nasty dementor.
4879,Remus Lupin,oh no no no.
4880,Remus Lupin,that was a boggart harry.
4881,Remus Lupin,a boggart.
4882,Remus Lupin,the real thing would be worse.
4883,Remus Lupin,much much worse.
4884,Remus Lupin,as a matter of interest what were you thinking?
4885,Remus Lupin,which memory did you choose?
4886,Harry Potter,the first time i rode a broom.
4887,Remus Lupin,that's not good enough.
4888,Remus Lupin,not nearly good enough.
4889,Harry Potter,there's another.
4890,Harry Potter,it's not... happy exactly.
4891,Harry Potter,well it is.
4892,Harry Potter,it's the happiest i've ever felt... but it's complicated.
4893,Remus Lupin,is it strong?
4894,Remus Lupin,then let's give it a try.
4895,Remus Lupin,you feel ready?
4896,Harry Potter,just do it.
4897,Harry Potter,expecto patronum!
4898,Harry Potter,expecto patronum!
4899,Remus Lupin,yes!
4900,Remus Lupin,well done harry.
4901,Remus Lupin,well done!
4902,Harry Potter,i think i've had enough for today.
4903,Remus Lupin,yes.
4904,Remus Lupin,sit down.
4905,Remus Lupin,here.
4906,Remus Lupin,eat this it helps.
4907,Remus Lupin,it really helps.
4908,Remus Lupin,and just so you know harry... i think you'd have given your father a run for his money.
4909,Remus Lupin,and that... is saying something.
4910,Harry Potter,i was thinking of him.
4911,Harry Potter,and mom.
4912,Harry Potter,seeing their faces.
4913,Harry Potter,they were talking to me.
4914,Harry Potter,just talking.
4915,Harry Potter,that's the memory i chose.
4916,Harry Potter,i don't even know if it's real.
4917,Harry Potter,but it's the best i have.
4918,Hermione Granger,beautiful day.
4919,Ron Weasley,gorgeous.
4920,Ron Weasley,unless of course you've been ripped to pieces!
4921,Harry Potter,ripped to pieces?
4922,Harry Potter,what are you talking about?
4923,Hermione Granger,ronald has lost his rat.
4924,Ron Weasley,i haven't lost anything!
4925,Ron Weasley,your cat killed him!
4926,Hermione Granger,rubbish.
4927,Ron Weasley,harry you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers... is always lurking about.
4928,Ron Weasley,and scabbers is gone.
4929,Hermione Granger,well maybe you should take better care of your pets!
4930,Ron Weasley,your cat killed him!
4931,Hermione Granger,did not.
4932,Ron Weasley,did.
4933,Hermione Granger,didn't.
4934,Hermione Granger,how did it go hagrid?
4935,Hermione Granger,the hearing?
4936,Rubeus Hagrid,well first off the committee members took turns... talking about why we were there.
4937,Rubeus Hagrid,and then i got up and did my piece.
4938,Rubeus Hagrid,said how buckbeak... was a good hippogriff always cleaned his feathers.
4939,Rubeus Hagrid,and then lucius malfoy got up.
4940,Rubeus Hagrid,well you can imagine.
4941,Rubeus Hagrid,he said buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature... who would kill you as soon as look at you.
4942,Hermione Granger,and then?
4943,Rubeus Hagrid,and then he asked for the worst did old lucius.
4944,Harry Potter,they're not sacking you!
4945,Rubeus Hagrid,no i'm not sacked.
4946,Rubeus Hagrid,buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
4947,Ron Weasley,spiders!
4948,Ron Weasley,there's... there's spiders.
4949,Ron Weasley,spiders.
4950,Ron Weasley,they want me to tap-dance.
4951,Ron Weasley,i don't wanna tap-dance!
4952,Harry Potter,you tell those spiders ron.
4953,Ron Weasley,right yeah.
4954,Ron Weasley,tell them.
4955,Ron Weasley,i'll tell them...
4956,Rosmerta,peter pettigrew?
4957,Minerva McGonagall,little lump of a boy.
4958,Minerva McGonagall,always trailing after sirius black.
4959,Cornelius Fudge,black was vicious.
4960,Cornelius Fudge,he didn't kill pettigrew he destroyed him!
4961,Ghost,put that light out!
4962,Harry Potter,sorry.
4963,Ghost,watch it there boy.
4964,Ghost,we're trying to sleep here!
4965,Ghost,yes we are.
4966,Harry Potter,mischief managed.
4967,Harry Potter,nox.
4968,Severus Snape,potter.
4969,Severus Snape,what are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
4970,Harry Potter,i was sleepwalking.
4971,Severus Snape,how extraordinarily like your father you are potter.
4972,Severus Snape,he too was exceedingly arrogant strutting about the castle.
4973,Harry Potter,my dad didn't strut.
4974,Harry Potter,and nor do i. now if you don't mind i would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
4975,Severus Snape,turn out your pockets.
4976,Severus Snape,turn out your pockets!
4977,Severus Snape,what's this?
4978,Harry Potter,spare bit of parchment.
4979,Severus Snape,really?
4980,Severus Snape,open it.
4981,Severus Snape,reveal your secrets.
4982,Severus Snape,read it.
4983,Harry Potter,mr's.
4984,Harry Potter,moony wormtail padfoot and prongs... offer their compliments to professor snape and...
4985,Severus Snape,go on.
4986,Harry Potter,and request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.
4987,Severus Snape,why you insolent little...
4988,Remus Lupin,professor!
4989,Severus Snape,well well.
4990,Severus Snape,lupin.
4991,Severus Snape,out for a little walk... in the moonlight are we?
4992,Remus Lupin,harry are you alright?
4993,Severus Snape,that remains to be seen.
4994,Severus Snape,i have just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from mr. potter.
4995,Severus Snape,take a look lupin.
4996,Severus Snape,supposed to be your area of expertise.
4997,Severus Snape,clearly it's full of dark magic.
4998,Remus Lupin,oh i seriously doubt it severus.
4999,Remus Lupin,it looks as though it's merely a parchment designed to insult anyone... who tries to read it.
5000,Remus Lupin,i suspect it's a zonko product.
5001,Remus Lupin,nevertheless i shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
5002,Remus Lupin,it is after all as you say my area of expertise.
5003,Remus Lupin,harry would you come with me please?
5004,Remus Lupin,professor good night.
5005,Ghost,are you deaf?
5006,Ghost,put that light out!
5007,Remus Lupin,come in.
5008,Remus Lupin,i haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession... but quite frankly i am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
5009,Remus Lupin,did it never occur to you that this in the hands of sirius black... is a map to you?
5010,Harry Potter,no.
5011,Harry Potter,no sir.
5012,Remus Lupin,your father never set much store by the rules either.
5013,Remus Lupin,but he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
5014,Remus Lupin,gambling their sacrifice by wandering around the castle unprotected... with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
5015,Remus Lupin,now i will not cover up for you again harry.
5016,Remus Lupin,do you hear me?
5017,Harry Potter,yes sir.
5018,Remus Lupin,i want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
5019,Remus Lupin,and don't take any detours.
5020,Remus Lupin,if you do i shall know.
5021,Harry Potter,professor just so you know i don't think that map always works.
5022,Harry Potter,earlier it showed someone in the castle.
5023,Harry Potter,someone i know to be dead.
5024,Remus Lupin,oh really?
5025,Remus Lupin,and who might that be?
5026,Harry Potter,peter pettigrew.
5027,Remus Lupin,that's not possible.
5028,Harry Potter,it's just what i saw.
5029,Harry Potter,good night professor.
5030,Sybill Trelawney,broaden your minds.
5031,Sybill Trelawney,you must look beyond.
5032,Sybill Trelawney,the art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the inner eye.
5033,Sybill Trelawney,only then can you see.
5034,Sybill Trelawney,try again.
5035,Sybill Trelawney,now what do we have here?
5036,Hermione Granger,oh do you mind me trying?
5037,Hermione Granger,the grim possibly.
5038,Sybill Trelawney,my dear from the first moment you stepped foot in my class... i sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit... for the noble art of divination.
5039,Sybill Trelawney,no you see there.
5040,Sybill Trelawney,you may be young in years but the heart that beats beneath your bosom is as shriveled as an old maid's your soul as dry as the pages of the books... to which you so desperately cleave.
5041,Sybill Trelawney,have i said something?
5042,Ron Weasley,she's gone mental hermione has.
5043,Ron Weasley,i mean not that she wasn't always mental... but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
5044,Harry Potter,hang on.
5045,Harry Potter,we better take this back.
5046,Ron Weasley,i'm not going back.
5047,Harry Potter,fine.
5048,Harry Potter,see you later.
5049,Ron Weasley,see you.
5050,Sirius Black,harry potter...
5051,Harry Potter,professor trelawney...
5052,Sybill Trelawney,he will return tonight.
5053,Harry Potter,sorry?
5054,Sybill Trelawney,tonight he who betrayed his friends whose heart rots with murder... shall break free.
5055,Sybill Trelawney,innocent blood shall be spilt... and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
5056,Sybill Trelawney,i'm so sorry dear boy.
5057,Sybill Trelawney,did you say something?
5058,Harry Potter,no.
5059,Harry Potter,nothing.
5060,Hermione Granger,i can't believe they're going to kill buckbeak.
5061,Hermione Granger,it's just too horrible.
5062,Ron Weasley,it just got worse.
5063,Draco Malfoy,now i'll tell you.
5064,Draco Malfoy,father said... i can keep the hippogriff's head.
5065,Draco Malfoy,i think i'll donate it to the gryffindors' room.
5066,Draco Malfoy,this is going to be rich.
5067,Draco Malfoy,look who's here.
5068,Draco Malfoy,come to see the show?
5069,Hermione Granger,you!
5070,Hermione Granger,you foul loathsome evil little cockroach!
5071,Ron Weasley,hermione no!
5072,Ron Weasley,he's not worth it.
5073,Vincent Crabbe,malfoy are you okay?
5074,Vincent Crabbe,let's go.
5075,Vincent Crabbe,quick.
5076,Draco Malfoy,not a word to anyone understood?
5077,Hermione Granger,that felt good.
5078,Ron Weasley,not good brilliant!
5079,Rubeus Hagrid,look at him.
5080,Rubeus Hagrid,loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
5081,Harry Potter,why don't we just set him free?
5082,Rubeus Hagrid,they'd know it was me and then dumbledore... would get into trouble.
5083,Rubeus Hagrid,he's coming down you know?
5084,Rubeus Hagrid,dumbledore.
5085,Rubeus Hagrid,says he wants to be with me when they... when it happens.
5086,Rubeus Hagrid,great man dumbledore.
5087,Rubeus Hagrid,a great man.
5088,Hermione Granger,we'll stay with you too hagrid.
5089,Rubeus Hagrid,you'll do no such thing!
5090,Rubeus Hagrid,think i want you seeing something like that?
5091,Rubeus Hagrid,no.
5092,Rubeus Hagrid,you just drink your tea and be off.
5093,Rubeus Hagrid,oh.
5094,Rubeus Hagrid,before you do ron...
5095,Ron Weasley,scabbers!
5096,Ron Weasley,you're alive!
5097,Rubeus Hagrid,keep a closer eye on your pets ron.

5176,Hermione Granger,where do you suppose this goes?
5177,Harry Potter,i have a hunch.
5178,Harry Potter,i just hope i'm wrong.
5179,Hermione Granger,we're in the shrieking shack aren't we?
5180,Harry Potter,come on.
5181,Harry Potter,ron.
5182,Hermione Granger,ron.
5183,Hermione Granger,you're okay.
5184,Hermione Granger,the dog.
5185,Hermione Granger,where is it?
5186,Ron Weasley,harry it's a trap.
5187,Ron Weasley,he's the dog.
5188,Ron Weasley,he's an animagus.
5189,Hermione Granger,if you want to kill harry you'll have to kill us too!
5190,Sirius Black,no.
5191,Sirius Black,only one will die tonight.
5192,Harry Potter,then it'll be you!
5193,Sirius Black,are you going to kill me harry?
5194,Remus Lupin,expelliarmus!
5195,Remus Lupin,well well sirius.
5196,Remus Lupin,looking rather ragged aren't we?
5197,Remus Lupin,finally the flesh reflects the madness within.
5198,Sirius Black,well you'd know all about the madness within wouldn't you remus?
5199,Sirius Black,i found him.
5200,Remus Lupin,i know.
5201,Sirius Black,it's him.
5202,Remus Lupin,i understand.
5203,Sirius Black,let's kill him!
5204,Hermione Granger,no!
5205,Hermione Granger,i trusted you!
5206,Hermione Granger,and all this time you've been his friend.
5207,Hermione Granger,he's a werewolf!
5208,Hermione Granger,that's why he's been missing classes.
5209,Remus Lupin,how long have you known?
5210,Hermione Granger,since professor snape set the essay.
5211,Remus Lupin,well well well hermione.
5212,Remus Lupin,you really are the brightest witch of your age i've ever met.
5213,Sirius Black,enough talk remus!
5214,Sirius Black,come on let's kill him!
5215,Remus Lupin,wait!
5216,Sirius Black,i did my waiting!
5217,Sirius Black,twelve years of it!
5218,Sirius Black,in azkaban!
5219,Remus Lupin,very well.
5220,Remus Lupin,kill him.
5221,Remus Lupin,but wait one more minute.
5222,Remus Lupin,harry has the right to know why.
5223,Harry Potter,i know why.
5224,Harry Potter,you betrayed my parents.
5225,Harry Potter,you're the reason they're dead!
5226,Remus Lupin,no harry it wasn't him.
5227,Remus Lupin,somebody did betray your parents... but it was somebody who until quite recently i believed to be dead!
5228,Harry Potter,who was it then?
5229,Sirius Black,peter pettigrew!
5230,Sirius Black,and he's in this room!
5231,Sirius Black,right now!
5232,Sirius Black,come out come out peter!
5233,Sirius Black,come out come out and play!
5234,Severus Snape,expelliarmus!
5235,Severus Snape,vengeance is sweet.
5236,Severus Snape,how i hoped i'd be the one to catch you.
5237,Sirius Black,severus...
5238,Severus Snape,i told dumbledore you were helping an old friend into the castle and now here's the proof.
5239,Sirius Black,brilliant snape.
5240,Sirius Black,once again you've put your keen penetrating mind to the task and as usual come to the wrong conclusion.
5241,Sirius Black,now if you'll excuse us remus and i have some unfinished business... to attend to.
5242,Severus Snape,give me a reason.
5243,Severus Snape,i beg you!
5244,Remus Lupin,severus don't be a fool.
5245,Sirius Black,he can't help it.
5246,Sirius Black,it's habit.
5247,Remus Lupin,sirius be quiet.
5248,Sirius Black,be quiet yourself remus!
5249,Severus Snape,oh listen to you two quarreling like an old married couple.
5250,Sirius Black,why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set!
5251,Severus Snape,i could do it you know.
5252,Severus Snape,but why deny the dementors?
5253,Severus Snape,they're so longing to see you.
5254,Severus Snape,do i detect a flicker of fear?
5255,Severus Snape,oh yes.
5256,Severus Snape,a dementor's kiss.
5257,Severus Snape,one can only imagine what that must be like.
5258,Severus Snape,it's said to be nearly unbearable to witness but i'll do my best.
5259,Remus Lupin,severus please.
5260,Severus Snape,after you.
5261,Harry Potter,expelliarmus!
5262,Ron Weasley,harry!
5263,Ron Weasley,what did you just do?
5264,Hermione Granger,you attacked a teacher!
5265,Harry Potter,tell me about peter.
5266,Remus Lupin,he was at school with us.
5267,Remus Lupin,we thought he was our friend!
5268,Harry Potter,no.
5269,Harry Potter,pettigrew's dead.
5270,Harry Potter,you killed him!
5271,Remus Lupin,no he didn't.
5272,Remus Lupin,i thought so too until you mentioned seeing pettigrew on the map!
5273,Harry Potter,the map was lying then.
5274,Sirius Black,the map never lies!
5275,Sirius Black,pettigrew's alive!
5276,Sirius Black,and he's right there!
5277,Ron Weasley,me?!
5278,Ron Weasley,he's mental!
5279,Sirius Black,not you!
5280,Sirius Black,your rat!
5281,Ron Weasley,scabbers has been in my family for...
5282,Sirius Black,twelve years?
5283,Sirius Black,curiously long life for a common garden rat!
5284,Sirius Black,he's missing a toe isn't he?
5285,Ron Weasley,so what?
5286,Harry Potter,all they could find of pettigrew was his...
5287,Sirius Black,finger!
5288,Sirius Black,that dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
5289,Sirius Black,and then he transformed into a rat!
5290,Harry Potter,show me.
5291,Harry Potter,give it to him ron.
5292,Ron Weasley,what are you trying to do to him?
5293,Ron Weasley,scabbers!
5294,Ron Weasley,leave him alone!
5295,Ron Weasley,get off him!
5296,Ron Weasley,what are you doing?
5297,Peter Pettigrew,remus?
5298,Peter Pettigrew,sirius.
5299,Peter Pettigrew,my old friends!
5300,Peter Pettigrew,harry!
5301,Peter Pettigrew,look at you!
5302,Peter Pettigrew,you look so much like your father!
5303,Peter Pettigrew,like james!
5304,Peter Pettigrew,we were the best of friends...
5305,Sirius Black,how dare you speak to harry!
5306,Sirius Black,how dare you talk about james in front of him!
5307,Remus Lupin,you sold james and lily to voldemort didn't you?
5308,Peter Pettigrew,i didn't mean to!
5309,Peter Pettigrew,the dark lord.
5310,Peter Pettigrew,you have no idea the weapons he possesses!
5311,Peter Pettigrew,ask yourself sirius!
5312,Peter Pettigrew,what would you have done?
5313,Peter Pettigrew,what would you have done?
5314,Sirius Black,i would have died!
5315,Sirius Black,i would have died rather than betray my friends!
5316,Peter Pettigrew,harry james wouldn't have wanted me killed!
5317,Peter Pettigrew,your dad... your dad would have spared me!
5318,Peter Pettigrew,he would show me mercy!
5319,Remus Lupin,you should've realized peter that if voldemort didn't kill you then we would!
5320,Remus Lupin,together!
5321,Harry Potter,no!
5322,Remus Lupin,harry this man...
5323,Harry Potter,i know what he is.
5324,Harry Potter,but we'll take him to the castle.
5325,Peter Pettigrew,bless you boy!
5326,Peter Pettigrew,bless you!
5327,Harry Potter,get off!
5328,Harry Potter,i said we'd take you to the castle.
5329,Harry Potter,after that the dementors can have you.
5330,Sirius Black,sorry about the bite.
5331,Sirius Black,i reckon that twinges a bit.
5332,Ron Weasley,a bit?
5333,Ron Weasley,a bit?
5334,Ron Weasley,you almost tore my leg off!
5335,Sirius Black,i was going for the rat.
5336,Sirius Black,normally i have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
5337,Sirius Black,in fact more than once james suggested that i make the change permanent.
5338,Sirius Black,the tail i could live with.
5339,Sirius Black,but the fleas they're murder.
5340,Harry Potter,okay.
5341,Ron Weasley,you better go.
5342,Harry Potter,no.
5343,Harry Potter,don't worry okay?
5344,Harry Potter,it's fine.
5345,Harry Potter,i'll stay.
5346,Hermione Granger,you go i'll stay.
5347,Harry Potter,you okay?
5348,Ron Weasley,i'm fine.
5349,Ron Weasley,go.
5350,Hermione Granger,that looks really painful.
5351,Ron Weasley,so painful.
5352,Ron Weasley,they might chop it.
5353,Hermione Granger,i'm sure madam pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
5354,Ron Weasley,it's too late.
5355,Ron Weasley,it's ruined.
5356,Ron Weasley,it'll have to be chopped off.
5357,Sirius Black,it's beautiful isn't it?
5358,Sirius Black,i'll never forget the first time i walked through those doors.
5359,Sirius Black,it'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
5360,Sirius Black,that was a noble thing you did back there.
5361,Sirius Black,he doesn't deserve it.
5362,Harry Potter,well i just didn't think my dad would have wanted his two best friends... to become killers.
5363,Harry Potter,besides dead the truth dies with him.
5364,Harry Potter,alive you're free.
5365,Peter Pettigrew,turn me into a maggot!
5366,Peter Pettigrew,turn me into a flobberworm!
5367,Peter Pettigrew,anything but the dementors!
5368,Peter Pettigrew,ron!
5369,Peter Pettigrew,haven't i been a good friend?
5370,Peter Pettigrew,a good pet?
5371,Peter Pettigrew,you won't let them give me to the dementors will you?
5372,Peter Pettigrew,i was your rat!
5373,Peter Pettigrew,sweet girl!
5374,Peter Pettigrew,clever girl!
5375,Peter Pettigrew,surely you won't let them...
5376,Remus Lupin,get away from her!
5377,Sirius Black,i don't know if you know harry... but when you were born james and lily made me your godfather.
5378,Harry Potter,i know.
5379,Sirius Black,i can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle... but if you ever wanted a different home...
5380,Harry Potter,what?
5381,Harry Potter,come and live with you?
5382,Sirius Black,it's just a thought.
5383,Sirius Black,i can understand if you don't want to.
5384,Hermione Granger,harry!
5385,Sirius Black,remus my old friend!
5386,Sirius Black,have you taken your potion tonight?
5387,Sirius Black,you know the man you truly are remus!
5388,Sirius Black,this heart is where you truly live!
5389,Sirius Black,this heart here!
5390,Sirius Black,this flesh is only flesh!
5391,Harry Potter,expelliarmus!
5392,Hermione Granger,harry!
5393,Sirius Black,remus!
5394,Sirius Black,remus!
5395,Sirius Black,run!
5396,Sirius Black,run!
5397,Harry Potter,come on.
5398,Hermione Granger,wait!
5399,Hermione Granger,wait!
5400,Ron Weasley,hermione!
5401,Ron Weasley,bad idea.
5402,Ron Weasley,bad idea.
5403,Hermione Granger,professor?
5404,Hermione Granger,professor lupin?
5405,Ron Weasley,nice doggy.
5406,Ron Weasley,nice doggy!
5407,Severus Snape,there you are potter!
5408,Harry Potter,sirius!
5409,Severus Snape,come back here potter!
5410,Harry Potter,sirius!
5411,Harry Potter,no.
5412,Harry Potter,sirius!
5413,Harry Potter,expecto patronum!
5414,Hermione Granger,harry?
5415,Harry Potter,i saw my dad.
5416,Hermione Granger,what?
5417,Harry Potter,he sent the dementors away.
5418,Harry Potter,i saw him across the lake.
5419,Hermione Granger,listen harry they've captured sirius.
5420,Hermione Granger,any minute the dementors are going to perform the kiss.
5421,Harry Potter,you mean they're gonna kill him?
5422,Hermione Granger,no.
5423,Hermione Granger,it's worse.
5424,Hermione Granger,much worse.
5425,Hermione Granger,they're going to suck out his soul.
5426,Hermione Granger,headmaster you've got to stop them.
5427,Hermione Granger,they've got the wrong man.
5428,Harry Potter,it's true.
5429,Harry Potter,sirius is innocent.
5430,Ron Weasley,it's scabbers who did it.
5431,Albus Dumbledore,scabbers?
5432,Ron Weasley,he's my rat sir.
5433,Ron Weasley,he's not really a rat.
5434,Ron Weasley,he was a rat.
5435,Ron Weasley,he was my brother percy's rat.
5436,Ron Weasley,but then they gave him an owl...
5437,Hermione Granger,the point is we know the truth.
5438,Hermione Granger,please believe us.
5439,Albus Dumbledore,i do miss granger.
5440,Albus Dumbledore,but the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
5441,Albus Dumbledore,a child's voice however honest and true... is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
5442,Albus Dumbledore,mysterious thing time.
5443,Albus Dumbledore,powerful... and when meddled with dangerous.
5444,Albus Dumbledore,sirius black is in the topmost cell of the dark tower.
5445,Albus Dumbledore,you know the laws miss granger.
5446,Albus Dumbledore,you must not be seen.
5447,Albus Dumbledore,and you would do well i feel to return before this last chime.
5448,Albus Dumbledore,if not the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
5449,Albus Dumbledore,if you succeed tonight... more than one innocent life may be spared.
5450,Albus Dumbledore,three turns should do it i think.
5451,Albus Dumbledore,oh and by the way.
5452,Albus Dumbledore,when in doubt i find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
5453,Albus Dumbledore,good luck.
5454,Ron Weasley,what the bloody hell was that all about?
5455,Hermione Granger,sorry ron but seeing as you can't walk...
5456,Harry Potter,what just happened?
5457,Harry Potter,where's ron?
5458,Hermione Granger,7:30. where were we at 7:30?
5459,Harry Potter,i don't know.
5460,Harry Potter,going to hagrid's?
5461,Hermione Granger,come on.
5462,Hermione Granger,and we can't be seen.
5463,Harry Potter,hermione!
5464,Harry Potter,hermione!
5465,Harry Potter,hermione wait.
5466,Harry Potter,hermione will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
5467,Hermione Granger,you foul loathsome evil little cockroach!
5468,Harry Potter,that's us.
5469,Ron Weasley,hermione no!
5470,Ron Weasley,he's not worth it.
5471,Harry Potter,this is not normal.
5472,Hermione Granger,this is a time-turner harry.
5473,Hermione Granger,mcgonagall gave it to me first term.
5474,Hermione Granger,this is how i've been getting to my lessons all year.
5475,Harry Potter,you mean we've gone back in time?
5476,Hermione Granger,yes.
5477,Hermione Granger,dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
5478,Hermione Granger,clearly something happened he wants us to change.
5479,Harry Potter,good punch.
5480,Hermione Granger,thanks.
5481,Hermione Granger,malfoy's coming.
5482,Vincent Crabbe,run.
5483,Draco Malfoy,not a word to anyone understood?
5484,Draco Malfoy,i'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!
5485,Draco Malfoy,mark my words.
5486,Hermione Granger,that felt good.
5487,Ron Weasley,not good brilliant.
5488,Harry Potter,come on.
5489,Harry Potter,we should be at hagrid's.
5490,Harry Potter,look.
5491,Harry Potter,buckbeak's still alive.
5492,Hermione Granger,of course.
5493,Hermione Granger,remember what dumbledore said?
5494,Hermione Granger,if we succeed more than one innocent life could be spared.
5495,Hermione Granger,let's go.
5496,Harry Potter,here they come.
5497,Harry Potter,i'd better hurry.
5498,Hermione Granger,fudge has to see buckbeak before we steal him.
5499,Hermione Granger,otherwise he'll think hagrid set him free.
5500,Ron Weasley,scabbers you're alive!
5501,Rubeus Hagrid,keep a closer eye on your pet ron.
5502,Harry Potter,that's pettigrew.
5503,Hermione Granger,harry you can't.
5504,Harry Potter,he betrayed my parents.
5505,Harry Potter,you don't expect me to sit here.
5506,Hermione Granger,yes and you must!
5507,Hermione Granger,harry you're in hagrid's hut now.
5508,Hermione Granger,if you just go bursting in you'll think you've gone mad.
5509,Hermione Granger,awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
5510,Hermione Granger,we can't be seen.
5511,Hermione Granger,fudge is coming.
5512,Hermione Granger,and we aren't leaving?
5513,Hermione Granger,why aren't we leaving?
5514,Harry Potter,are you mad?
5515,Harry Potter,ow!
5516,Harry Potter,ow!
5517,Harry Potter,that hurt!
5518,Hermione Granger,sorry.
5519,Hermione Granger,we're coming out the back door.

5579,Cornelius Fudge,hagrid?
5580,Hermione Granger,buckbeak.
5581,Albus Dumbledore,i don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
5582,Albus Dumbledore,how could you?
5583,Albus Dumbledore,you've been with us all the time.
5584,Cornelius Fudge,right.

5606,Harry Potter,yeah.
5607,Harry Potter,hermione?
5608,Hermione Granger,yeah?
5609,Harry Potter,before down by the lake when i was with sirius... i did see someone.
5610,Harry Potter,that someone made the dementors go away.
5611,Hermione Granger,with a patronus.
5612,Hermione Granger,i heard snape telling dumbledore.
5613,Hermione Granger,according to him... only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
5614,Harry Potter,it was my dad.
5615,Harry Potter,my dad conjured the patronus.
5616,Hermione Granger,harry but your dad's... dead.
5617,Hermione Granger,i know.
5618,Hermione Granger,i'm just telling you what i saw.
5619,Hermione Granger,here we come.
5620,Harry Potter,you see sirius talking to me there?
5621,Harry Potter,he's asking me to come live with him.
5622,Hermione Granger,that's great.
5623,Harry Potter,when we free him i'll never have to go back to the dursleys'.
5624,Harry Potter,it'll just be me and him.
5625,Harry Potter,we could live in the country... someplace you can see the sky.
5626,Harry Potter,i think he'll like that after all those years in azkaban.
5627,Hermione Granger,harry!
5628,Hermione Granger,run!
5629,Harry Potter,let's go!
5630,Harry Potter,what are you doing?

5637,Hermione Granger,that was so scary.
5638,Harry Potter,poor professor lupin's having a really tough night.
5639,Harry Potter,sirius!
5640,Harry Potter,come on!
5641,Hermione Granger,this is horrible.
5642,Harry Potter,don't worry.
5643,Harry Potter,my dad will come.
5644,Harry Potter,he'll conjure the patronus.
5645,Harry Potter,any minute now!
5646,Harry Potter,right there!
5647,Harry Potter,you'll see!
5648,Hermione Granger,harry listen to me.

5653,Hermione Granger,you're dying... both of you.
5654,Hermione Granger,harry!
5655,Harry Potter,expecto patronum!
5656,Harry Potter,you were right hermione.
5657,Harry Potter,it wasn't my dad i saw earlier.
5658,Harry Potter,it was me!
5659,Harry Potter,i saw myself conjuring the patronus before.
5660,Harry Potter,i knew i could do it this time because... well i had already done it.
5661,Harry Potter,does that make sense?
5662,Hermione Granger,no.
5663,Hermione Granger,but i don't like flying...!
5664,Hermione Granger,bombarda!
5665,Sirius Black,i'll be forever grateful for this... to both of you.
5666,Harry Potter,i want to go with you.
5667,Sirius Black,one day perhaps.
5668,Sirius Black,for some time my life will be too unpredictable.
5669,Sirius Black,and besides... you're meant to be here.
5670,Harry Potter,but you're innocent.
5671,Sirius Black,and you know it.
5672,Sirius Black,and for now that will do.
5673,Sirius Black,i expect you're tired of hearing this... but you look so like your father.
5674,Sirius Black,except your eyes.
5675,Sirius Black,you have...
5676,Harry Potter,my mother's eyes.
5677,Sirius Black,it's cruel that i spent so much time with james and lily and you so little.
5678,Sirius Black,but know this: the ones that love us never really leave us.
5679,Sirius Black,and you can always find them... in here.
5680,Sirius Black,you really are the brightest witch of your age.
5681,Hermione Granger,we have to go.
5682,Albus Dumbledore,well?
5683,Harry Potter,he's free.

5701,Harry Potter,resigned?
5702,Harry Potter,why?

5704,Remus Lupin,this time tomorrow the owls will start arriving and parents will not want... well someone like me teaching their children.
5705,Harry Potter,but dumbledore...
5706,Remus Lupin,dumbledore has already... risked enough on my behalf.
5707,Remus Lupin,besides people like me are... well let's just say that i'm used to it by now.
5708,Remus Lupin,why do you look so miserable harry?
5709,Harry Potter,none of it made any difference.
5710,Harry Potter,pettigrew escaped.
5711,Remus Lupin,didn't make any difference?
5712,Remus Lupin,harry it made all the difference in the world.
5713,Remus Lupin,you have uncovered the truth.
5714,Remus Lupin,you saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
5715,Remus Lupin,it made a great deal of difference.
5716,Remus Lupin,if i am proud of anything... it is of how much you have learned this year.
5717,Remus Lupin,now since i am no longer your teacher... i feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
5718,Remus Lupin,so now i'll say goodbye harry.

5895,Hermione Granger,this is horrible how can the ministry not know who conjured it.
5896,Hermione Granger,isn't there any security or?
5897,Ron Weasley,loads according to dad that's what worried them so much.
5898,Ron Weasley,happened right under their noses.
5899,Hermione Granger,it's hurting again isn't it your scar.
5900,Harry Potter,i'm fine.
5901,Hermione Granger,you know sirius will want to hear about this.
5902,Hermione Granger,what you saw at the world cup and the dream.
5903,Rubeus Hagrid,clear the runway.
5904,Harry Potter,well there's something you don't see every day.
5905,Albus Dumbledore,now we're all settled in and sorted i'd like to make an announcement.
5906,Albus Dumbledore,this castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very special guests as well.
5907,Albus Dumbledore,you see hogwarts has been choosen...
5908,Albus Dumbledore,so hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event.
5909,Albus Dumbledore,the tri-wizard tournament.
5910,Albus Dumbledore,now for those of you who do not know the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests.
5911,Albus Dumbledore,from each school a single contestant is selected to compete.
5912,Albus Dumbledore,now let me be clear if choosen you stand alone.
5913,Albus Dumbledore,and trust me when i say these contests are not for the faint hearted but more of that later.
5914,Albus Dumbledore,for now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the beauxbatons academy of magic and their headmistress madam maxime.
5915,Student,blimey that's one big woman.
5916,Albus Dumbledore,and now our friends from the north please greet the proud sons of durmstrang and the high master igor karkaroff.
5917,Ron Weasley,blimey it's him viktor krum!
5918,Igor Karkaroff,albus!
5919,Albus Dumbledore,igor.
5920,Olympe Maxime,professor dumbledore my horses have travelled a long way.
5921,Olympe Maxime,they will need attending to.
5922,Albus Dumbledore,not to worry madame maxime our gamekeeper hagrid's more than capable of seeing to them.
5923,Olympe Maxime,but you know monsieur hagrid they drink only single malt whiskey.
5924,Filius Flitwick,you idiot!
5925,Albus Dumbledore,your attention please!
5926,Albus Dumbledore,i would like to say a few words.
5927,Albus Dumbledore,eternal glory that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament.
5928,Albus Dumbledore,but to do this that student must survive three tasks.
5929,Albus Dumbledore,three extremely dangerous tasks.
5930,Fred Weasley,wicked.
5931,Albus Dumbledore,for this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule.
5932,Albus Dumbledore,to explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic cooperation mister bartimus crouch.
5933,Ron Weasley,bloody hell it's mad-eye moody.
5934,Hermione Granger,alastor moody?
5935,Hermione Granger,the aura.
5936,Ron Weasley,he was a catcher.
5937,Ron Weasley,half the cells in azkaban are full thanks to him.
5938,Ron Weasley,he's supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days.
5939,Albus Dumbledore,my dear old friend thanks for coming.
5940,Alastor Moody,that stupid roof.
5941,Seamus Finnigan,what's that he's drinking do you suppose?
5942,Harry Potter,i don't know but i don't think it's pumpkin juice.
5943,Bartemius Crouch,after much deliberation the ministry has concluded that for their own safety no student under the age of seventeen shall be allowed to put forth their name for the tri-wizard tournament.
5944,Bartemius Crouch,this decision is final.
5945,George Weasley,that's rubbish!
5946,George Weasley,you don't know what you're doing!
5947,Albus Dumbledore,silence!
5948,Albus Dumbledore,the goblet of fire.
5949,Albus Dumbledore,anyone wishing to submit themselves for the tournament merely write their name upon a piece of parchment and throw it in the flame before this hour on thursday night.
5950,Albus Dumbledore,do not do so lightly if choosen there's no turning back.
5951,Albus Dumbledore,as from this moment the tri-wizard tournament has begun.
5952,Alastor Moody,alastor moody.
5953,Alastor Moody,ministry malcontent.
5954,Alastor Moody,and your new defence against the dark arts teacher.
5955,Alastor Moody,i'm here because dumbledore asked me end of story goodbye the end.
5956,Alastor Moody,any questions?
5957,Alastor Moody,when it comes to the dark arts i believe in a practical approach.
5958,Alastor Moody,but first which of you can tell me how many unforgivable curses there are?
5959,Hermione Granger,three sir.
5960,Alastor Moody,and they are so named?
5961,Hermione Granger,because they are unforgivable.
5962,Hermione Granger,use of any one of them will...
5963,Alastor Moody,will earn you a one way ticket to azkaban.
5964,Alastor Moody,correct.
5965,Alastor Moody,now the ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do.
5966,Alastor Moody,i say different!
5967,Alastor Moody,you need to know what you're up against you need to be prepared you need to find somewhere else to put your chewing gum other than the underside of your desk mr finnigan!
5968,Seamus Finnigan,aw no way the old codger can see out the back of his head.
5969,Alastor Moody,so which curse shall we see first?
5970,Ron Weasley,yes...
5971,Alastor Moody,give us a curse.
5972,Ron Weasley,well my dad did tell me about one... the imperious curse.
5973,Alastor Moody,ahhh yes your father would know all about that.
5974,Alastor Moody,gave the ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago.
5975,Alastor Moody,perhaps this will show you why.
5976,Alastor Moody,hello.
5977,Alastor Moody,what a little beauty.
5978,Alastor Moody,don't worry.
5979,Alastor Moody,completely harmless.
5980,Alastor Moody,but if she bites... she's lethal!
5981,Alastor Moody,what are you laughing at?
5982,Alastor Moody,talented isn't she?
5983,Alastor Moody,what shall i have her do next?
5984,Alastor Moody,jump out the window?
5985,Alastor Moody,drown herself?
5986,Alastor Moody,scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only do did you-know-whose bidding under the influence of the imperious curse.
5987,Alastor Moody,but here's the rub how do we sort out the liars?
5988,Alastor Moody,another.. another.. come on come on.
5989,Alastor Moody,longbottom is it?
5990,Alastor Moody,up.
5991,Alastor Moody,professor sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology.
5992,Neville Longbottom,there's the um... the cruciatus curse.
5993,Alastor Moody,correct!
5994,Alastor Moody,correct!
5995,Alastor Moody,come come.
5996,Alastor Moody,particularly nasty.
5997,Alastor Moody,the torture curse.
5998,Hermione Granger,stop it!
5999,Hermione Granger,can't you see it's bothering him stop it!
6000,Alastor Moody,perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable curse miss granger.
6001,Alastor Moody,the killing curse.
6002,Alastor Moody,only one person is known to have survived it.
6003,Alastor Moody,and he's sitting in this room.
6004,Ron Weasley,brilliant isn't he!
6005,Ron Weasley,completely demented of course.
6006,Ron Weasley,terrifying to be in the same room with he's really been there you know.
6007,Hermione Granger,there's a reason those curses are unforgivable and to perform them in a classroom.
6008,Hermione Granger,i mean did you see neville's face.
6009,Hermione Granger,neville?
6010,Alastor Moody,son.
6011,Alastor Moody,you alright?
6012,Alastor Moody,come on we'll have a cup of tea.
6013,Alastor Moody,i want to show you something.
6014,Ron Weasley,eternal glory be brilliant wouldn't it?
6015,Ron Weasley,in three years from now we'll be old enough to be choosen.
6016,Harry Potter,yeah well rather you than me.
6017,George Weasley,thank you thank you well lads we've done it.
6018,Fred Weasley,cooked it up just this morning.
6019,Hermione Granger,it's not going to work.
6020,Fred Weasley,oh yeah?
6021,Fred Weasley,and why's that granger.
6022,Hermione Granger,you see this?
6023,Hermione Granger,this is an age line.
6024,Hermione Granger,dumbledore drew it himself.
6025,Fred Weasley,so?
6026,Hermione Granger,so a genius like dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion.
6027,George Weasley,that's why it's so brilliant.
6028,George Weasley,ready fred?
6029,Fred Weasley,ready george?
6030,George Weasley,you said..
6031,Albus Dumbledore,sit down please.
6032,Albus Dumbledore,and now the moment you've all been waiting for the champions selection!
6033,Albus Dumbledore,the durmstrang champion is ... viktor krum!
6034,Albus Dumbledore,the champion from beauxbatons... fleur delacour
6035,Albus Dumbledore,the hogwarts champion... cedric diggory.
6036,Albus Dumbledore,excellent!
6037,Albus Dumbledore,we now have our three champions!
6038,Albus Dumbledore,but in the end only one will go down in history.
6039,Albus Dumbledore,only one will hoist this chalice of champions this vessel of victory the tri-wizard cup!
6040,Albus Dumbledore,harry potter.
6041,Albus Dumbledore,harry potter?
6042,Rubeus Hagrid,no... no.
6043,Albus Dumbledore,harry potter!
6044,Hermione Granger,go on harry.
6045,Hermione Granger,harry for goodness sake.
6046,Student,he's a cheat!
6047,Student,he's not even seventeen yet.
6048,Albus Dumbledore,harry!
6049,Albus Dumbledore,did you put your name in the goblet of fire?
6050,Harry Potter,no sir.
6051,Albus Dumbledore,did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?
6052,Harry Potter,no sir.
6053,Albus Dumbledore,you're absolutely sure?
6054,Harry Potter,yes sir.
6055,Olympe Maxime,well of course he is lying.
6056,Alastor Moody,the hell he is.
6057,Alastor Moody,the goblet of fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object only an exceptionally powerful conjurer could have hoodwinked it.
6058,Alastor Moody,magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year.
6059,Igor Karkaroff,you seem to have given this a fair bit of thought mad-eye.
6060,Alastor Moody,it was once my job to think as dark wizards do karkaroff perhaps you remember?
6061,Albus Dumbledore,that doesn't help alastor.
6062,Albus Dumbledore,leave this to you barty.
6063,Bartemius Crouch,the rules are absolute the goblet of fire constitutes a binding magical contract.
6064,Bartemius Crouch,mr potter has no choice he is as of tonight... a tri-wizards champion.
6065,Minerva McGonagall,this can't go on albus.
6066,Minerva McGonagall,first the dark mark now this?
6067,Albus Dumbledore,what do you suggest minerva?
6068,Minerva McGonagall,put an end to it.
6069,Minerva McGonagall,don't let potter compete.
6070,Albus Dumbledore,you heard barty the rules are clear.
6071,Minerva McGonagall,well the devil with barty and his rules.
6072,Minerva McGonagall,and since when did you accomodate them...
6073,Severus Snape,master i too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events perhaps we should for the time being let them unfold.
6074,Minerva McGonagall,do nothing??
6075,Minerva McGonagall,offer him up as bait?
6076,Minerva McGonagall,potter is a boy not a piece of meat.
6077,Albus Dumbledore,i agree with severus.
6078,Albus Dumbledore,alastor keep an eye on harry will you?
6079,Alastor Moody,i can do that.
6080,Albus Dumbledore,don't let him know though he must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead.
6081,Albus Dumbledore,then again we all are.
6082,Ron Weasley,how did you do it?
6083,Ron Weasley,never mind.
6084,Ron Weasley,doesn't matter.
6085,Ron Weasley,you could have let your best friend know though.
6086,Harry Potter,let you know what?
6087,Ron Weasley,you know bloody well what.
6088,Harry Potter,i didn't ask for this to happen ron.
6089,Harry Potter,okay?
6090,Harry Potter,you're being stupid.
6091,Ron Weasley,yeah that's me ron weasley... harry potter's stupid friend.
6092,Harry Potter,i didn't put my name in that cup.
6093,Harry Potter,i don't want eternal glory i just wanna be.. look i don't know what happened tonight and i don't know why it just did ok.
6094,Ron Weasley,piss off.
6095,Rita Skeeter,what a charismatic quartet.
6096,Rita Skeeter,hello!
6097,Rita Skeeter,i'm rita skeeter i write for the daily prophet.
6098,Rita Skeeter,but of course you know that don't you.

6101,Rita Skeeter,what mysteries do the muscles mask?
6102,Rita Skeeter,does courage lie beneath those curls?
6103,Rita Skeeter,in short what makes a champion tick.
6104,Rita Skeeter,me myself and i want to know.
6105,Rita Skeeter,not to mention my rabid readers.
6106,Rita Skeeter,so who's feeling up to sharing?
6107,Rita Skeeter,mmm?

6113,Rita Skeeter,don't mind if i use the quill do you?
6114,Harry Potter,oh no.
6115,Rita Skeeter,so harry here you sit a mere boy of twelve..
6116,Harry Potter,i'm fourteen.
6117,Rita Skeeter,...about to compete against three students.
6118,Rita Skeeter,not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself but have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams.
6119,Rita Skeeter,concerned?
6120,Harry Potter,i dunno i haven't really thought about it.
6121,Rita Skeeter,course you're not just any ordinary boy of twelve are you...
6122,Harry Potter,fourteen.
6123,Rita Skeeter,the story's legend.
6124,Rita Skeeter,do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament.
6125,Harry Potter,no i didn't enter.
6126,Rita Skeeter,course you didn't.
6127,Rita Skeeter,everyone loves a rebel harry.
6128,Rita Skeeter,scratch that last.
6129,Rita Skeeter,speaking of your parents were they alive how do you think they'd feel?
6130,Rita Skeeter,proud?
6131,Rita Skeeter,or concerned that your attitude shows at best a pathological need for attention at worst a psychotic deathwish.
6132,Harry Potter,hey my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past.
6133,Sirius Black,harry.
6134,Sirius Black,i couldn't risk sending edward.
6135,Sirius Black,it was since the world cup and the ministry's been intercepting more and more owls and she's too easily recognised.
6136,Sirius Black,we need to talk harry.
6137,Sirius Black,face to face.
6138,Sirius Black,meet me in the griffindore common room at one o clock this saturday night and make sure you're alone.

6144,Harry Potter,sirius?!
6145,Harry Potter,how...
6146,Sirius Black,i don't have much time harry so let me get straight to it.
6147,Sirius Black,did you or did you not put your name into the goblet of fire?
6148,Harry Potter,no!
6149,Sirius Black,shh... i had to ask.
6150,Sirius Black,now tell me about this dream of yours.
6151,Sirius Black,you mentioned wormtail and voldemort but who was the third man in the room?
6152,Harry Potter,i dunno.
6153,Sirius Black,you didn't hear a name?
6154,Harry Potter,no.
6155,Harry Potter,umm.. voldemort was giving him a job to do.
6156,Harry Potter,something important.
6157,Sirius Black,what was that?
6158,Harry Potter,he wanted... me.
6159,Harry Potter,i dunno why but he was gonna use this man to get to me.
6160,Harry Potter,i mean it was only a dream right?
6161,Sirius Black,yes.
6162,Sirius Black,it's just a dream.
6163,Sirius Black,look harry the deatheaters at the world cup your name rising from that goblet these are not just coincidences.
6164,Sirius Black,hogwarts isn't safe any more.
6165,Harry Potter,what are you saying?
6166,Sirius Black,i'm saying the devils are inside the walls.
6167,Sirius Black,igor karkaroff he was a deatheater.
6168,Sirius Black,and no one no one stops being a deatheater.
6169,Sirius Black,then there's barty crouch heart of stone sent his own son to azkaban.
6170,Harry Potter,do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?
6171,Sirius Black,i haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet harry but whoever did it is no friend to you.
6172,Sirius Black,people die in this tournament.
6173,Harry Potter,i'm not ready for this sirius.
6174,Sirius Black,you don't have a choice.
6175,Harry Potter,someone's coming!
6176,Sirius Black,keep your friends close harry.
6177,Ron Weasley,who you talking to?

6227,Rubeus Hagrid,they're seriously misunderstood creatures.
6228,Rubeus Hagrid,although i have to admit that horntail is a right nasty piece of work.
6229,Rubeus Hagrid,poor ron nearly fainted just seeing him you know.

6258,Ron Weasley,fine.
6259,Draco Malfoy,why so tense potter?
6260,Draco Malfoy,my father and i have a bet you see.
6261,Draco Malfoy,i don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament.
6262,Draco Malfoy,he disagrees.
6263,Draco Malfoy,he thinks you won't last
6264,Harry Potter,i don't give a damn what you or your father thinks malfoy.
6265,Harry Potter,he's vile and cruel and you're just pathetic.
6266,Alastor Moody,i'll teach you to cast when someone's back is turned.
6267,Minerva McGonagall,professor moody what are you doing?
6268,Alastor Moody,teaching.
6269,Minerva McGonagall,is that a student?
6270,Alastor Moody,technically it's a ferret.
6271,Draco Malfoy,my father will hear about this!
6272,Alastor Moody,is that a threat!
6273,Alastor Moody,i could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair boy!
6274,Alastor Moody,it doesn't end here!
6275,Minerva McGonagall,we never use transfigration as a punishment surely dumbledore told you that.
6276,Alastor Moody,he might've mentioned it.
6277,Minerva McGonagall,well you will do well to remember it.
6278,Alastor Moody,come with me.
6279,Alastor Moody,that's a foal glass.
6280,Alastor Moody,lets me keep an eye on my enemies.
6281,Alastor Moody,if i can see the whites of their eyes they're standing right behind me.
6282,Alastor Moody,wouldn't even bother telling you what's in ther.
6283,Alastor Moody,you wouldn't believe it if i did.
6284,Alastor Moody,now... what are you going to do about your dragon?
6285,Harry Potter,oh... um... you know i just thought i'd...
6286,Alastor Moody,sit.
6287,Alastor Moody,listen to me potter.
6288,Alastor Moody,your pal diggory by your age he could take a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time.
6289,Alastor Moody,miss delacour she's as much a fairy princess as i am.
6290,Alastor Moody,as for krum his head may be filled with sawdust but karkaroff's is not.
6291,Alastor Moody,they'll have a strategy and you can bet that it'll play to krum's strengths.
6292,Alastor Moody,hmm?
6293,Alastor Moody,come on potter.
6294,Alastor Moody,what are your strengths?
6295,Harry Potter,um... i dunno.. i can fly.

6360,Harry Potter,caught on have you.
6361,Harry Potter,took you long enough.
6362,Ron Weasley,wasn't just me who thought you'd done it.

6370,Ron Weasley,i told hermione to tell you that seamus told me that parvati told dean that hagrid was looking for you.
6371,Ron Weasley,seamus never actually told me anything so it was really me all along.
6372,Ron Weasley,i thought you'd be alright you know after you figured that out.
6373,Harry Potter,who could possibly figure that out?
6374,Harry Potter,that's completely mental.
6375,Ron Weasley,yeah it is isn't it.

6397,Hermione Granger,they're not for ginny they're for you!
6398,Hermione Granger,dress robes.
6399,Ron Weasley,dress robes?
6400,Ron Weasley,for what?
6401,Minerva McGonagall,the yule ball has been a tradition of the tri-wizard tournament since its inception.
6402,Minerva McGonagall,on christmas eve night we and our guests gather in the great hall for well mannered frivolity.
6403,Minerva McGonagall,as representitives of the host school i expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward and i mean this literally because the yule ball is first and foremost... a dance.
6404,Minerva McGonagall,silence.
6405,Minerva McGonagall,the house of godrick griffindore has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly ten centuries.
6406,Minerva McGonagall,i will not have you in the course of a single evening besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling bumbling band of baboons.
6407,Fred Weasley,try saying that five times faster.
6408,Minerva McGonagall,now to dance is to let the body breathe inside every girl a secret swan slumbers longing to burst forth and take flight.
6409,Ron Weasley,something's about to burst out of hilary but i don't think it's a swan.
6410,Minerva McGonagall,inside every boy a lordly lion prepared to prance.
6411,Minerva McGonagall,mr weasly will you join me.
6412,Minerva McGonagall,now place your right hand on my waist.
6413,Ron Weasley,where?
6414,Minerva McGonagall,my waist.
6415,Minerva McGonagall,now bend your arm.
6416,Minerva McGonagall,mr filch...
6417,Minerva McGonagall,one two three one two three one two three.
6418,Harry Potter,oi!
6419,Harry Potter,never gonna let him forget this are you?
6420,Fred Weasley,never.
6421,George Weasley,never.
6422,Minerva McGonagall,everybody come together.
6423,Minerva McGonagall,boys on your feet.
6424,Harry Potter,why do they always have to travel in packs?
6425,Harry Potter,how are you supposed to get one alone to ask them...
6426,Ron Weasley,blimey harry you slayed dragons.
6427,Ron Weasley,if you can't get a date who can?
6428,Harry Potter,i think i'd take the dragon right now.
6429,Rubeus Hagrid,i take after my mum.
6430,Rubeus Hagrid,though i didn't know her very well she left when i was about three.
6431,Rubeus Hagrid,no not the maternal sort her broke my dad's heart though.
6432,Rubeus Hagrid,you know he was a tiny little fellow my dad i could pick him up with one hand by the age of six and put him up in the dresser.
6433,Rubeus Hagrid,and then he died when i was still in school.
6434,Rubeus Hagrid,so i had to make me own way as it were.
6435,Rubeus Hagrid,but enough of me what about you!
6436,Ron Weasley,this is mad.
6437,Ron Weasley,at this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.
6438,Ron Weasley,well us and neville!
6439,Harry Potter,but then again he can take himself.
6440,Hermione Granger,it might interest you to know that neville's already got someone.
6441,Ron Weasley,now i'm really depressed.
6442,Ron Weasley,well hermione you're a girl.
6443,Hermione Granger,oh well spotted.
6444,Ron Weasley,come on.
6445,Ron Weasley,it's one thing for a bloke to show up alone.
6446,Ron Weasley,for a girl it's just sad.
6447,Hermione Granger,i won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me.
6448,Hermione Granger,and i said yes.
6449,Ron Weasley,bloody hell.
6450,Ron Weasley,look.
6451,Ron Weasley,we've just got to grit our teeth and do it.
6452,Ron Weasley,tonight when we get back to the common room we'll both have partners.
6453,Ron Weasley,agreed?
6454,Harry Potter,agreed.
6455,Cho Chang,harry!
6456,Harry Potter,cho!
6457,Cho Chang,watch yourself on the stairs it's a bit icey at the top.
6458,Harry Potter,ok thanks.
6459,Harry Potter,cho?
6460,Cho Chang,yes?
6461,Harry Potter,um.
6462,Harry Potter,i just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me?
6463,Cho Chang,sorry?
6464,Cho Chang,i didn't catch that.
6465,Harry Potter,um.
6466,Harry Potter,i was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
6467,Cho Chang,oh.
6468,Cho Chang,um.
6469,Cho Chang,harry i'm sorry but someone's already asked me.
6470,Cho Chang,and well i've said i'll go with him.
6471,Harry Potter,ok. great.
6472,Harry Potter,fine.
6473,Harry Potter,no problem.
6474,Harry Potter,good.
6475,Cho Chang,harry i really am sorry.
6476,Harry Potter,what happened to you?
6477,Student,he just asked fleur delacour out.
6478,Hermione Granger,what?
6479,Harry Potter,what did she say?
6480,Hermione Granger,no of course.
6481,Hermione Granger,she said yes?
6483,Harry Potter,don't be silly.
6484,Ron Weasley,there she was walking by.
6485,Ron Weasley,you know i like it when they walk.
6486,Ron Weasley,i couldn't help it it just sort of slipped out.
6487,Student,actually he sort of screamed at her it was a bit frightening.
6488,Harry Potter,what did you do then?
6489,Ron Weasley,what else?
6490,Ron Weasley,i ran for it.
6491,Ron Weasley,i'm not cut out for this harry.
6492,Ron Weasley,i don't know what got into me.
6493,Parvati Patil,hi harry.
6494,Padma Patil,hi harry.
6495,Harry Potter,hey!
6496,Ron Weasley,bloody hell.
6497,Ron Weasley,what are those?
6499,Harry Potter,my dress robes.
6500,Ron Weasley,well they're alright.
6501,Ron Weasley,no lace no dodgy little collar.
6502,Harry Potter,well i expect yours are more traditional.
6503,Ron Weasley,traditional??
6504,Ron Weasley,they're ancient!
6505,Ron Weasley,i look like my great aunt tessie.
6506,Ron Weasley,i smell like my great aunt tessie.
6507,Ron Weasley,murder me harry.
6508,Harry Potter,leave it alone.
6509,Ron Weasley,poor kid bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out.
6510,Harry Potter,who?
6511,Ron Weasley,hermione of course.
6512,Ron Weasley,come on harry why'd you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?
6513,Harry Potter,because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.
6514,Ron Weasley,because nobody asked her.
6515,Ron Weasley,i would have taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding proud.
6516,Parvati Patil,hello boys.
6517,Parvati Patil,don't you look...
6518,Parvati Patil,... dashing.
6519,Minerva McGonagall,here you are potter.
6520,Minerva McGonagall,are you and miss patil ready?
6521,Harry Potter,ready professor?
6522,Minerva McGonagall,to dance.
6523,Minerva McGonagall,it's traditional that the three champions or in this case four are the first to dance.
6524,Minerva McGonagall,surely i told you that.
6525,Harry Potter,no.
6526,Minerva McGonagall,oh well now you know.
6527,Minerva McGonagall,oh as for your mr weasly you may proceed into the great hall with miss patil.
6528,Parvati Patil,she looks beautiful.
6529,Harry Potter,yeah she does.
6530,Padma Patil,is that hermione granger?
6531,Padma Patil,with viktor krum?
6533,Ron Weasley,no.
6534,Ron Weasley,absolutely not.
6535,Parvati Patil,harry.
6536,Parvati Patil,take my waist.
6537,Harry Potter,what?
6538,Parvati Patil,now.
6539,Hermione Granger,hot isn't it?
6540,Hermione Granger,viktor's gone to get drinks.
6541,Hermione Granger,care to join us?
6542,Ron Weasley,no we'd not care to join you and viktor.
6543,Hermione Granger,what's got your wand in a knot?
6544,Ron Weasley,he's a durmstrang.
6545,Ron Weasley,you're fraternising with the enemy.
6546,Hermione Granger,the enemy??
6547,Hermione Granger,who was it wanting his autograph?
6548,Hermione Granger,besides the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation to make friends.
6549,Ron Weasley,hrmph i think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind.
6550,Padma Patil,are you going to ask me to dance or not?
6551,Ron Weasley,no.
6552,Ron Weasley,he's using you.
6553,Hermione Granger,how dare you!
6554,Hermione Granger,besides i can take care of myself.
6555,Ron Weasley,doubt it.
6556,Ron Weasley,he's way too old.
6557,Hermione Granger,what?
6558,Hermione Granger,what?
6559,Hermione Granger,that's what you think?
6560,Ron Weasley,yeah that is what i think.
6561,Hermione Granger,you know the solution then don't you.
6562,Ron Weasley,go on.
6563,Hermione Granger,next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does and not as a last resort.
6564,Ron Weasley,well that's completely off the point.
6565,Ron Weasley,harry...
6566,Hermione Granger,where have you been?
6567,Hermione Granger,nevermind!
6568,Hermione Granger,off to bed both of you.
6569,Ron Weasley,they get scary when they get older.
6570,Hermione Granger,ron you spoil everything!
6571,Voldemort,let me see it again.
6572,Voldemort,ah yes the time is close now.
6573,Voldemort,harry!
6574,Voldemort,at last!
6575,Voldemort,step aside wormtail so i can give our guest a proper greeting!
6576,Neville Longbottom,you alright harry?
6577,Neville Longbottom,i just got in.
6578,Neville Longbottom,me!
6579,Hermione Granger,harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.
6580,Hermione Granger,the task is two days from now.
6581,Harry Potter,really?
6582,Harry Potter,i had no idea.
6583,Harry Potter,i suppose viktor's already figured it out.
6584,Hermione Granger,i wouldn't know we didn't actually talk about the tournament.
6585,Hermione Granger,actually we didn't really talk at all viktor's more of a physical being.
6586,Hermione Granger,i just mean he's not particularly... mostly he watches me study.
6587,Hermione Granger,it's a bit annoying actually.
6588,Hermione Granger,you are trying to figure this egg out aren't you?
6589,Harry Potter,what's that supposed to mean?
6590,Hermione Granger,i mean these tasks are supposed to test you in the most brutal way they're almost cruel.
6591,Hermione Granger,and um i'm scared for you.
6592,Hermione Granger,you got by the dragon mostly on nerve i'm not sure it's going to be enough this time.
6593,Cedric Diggory,hey potter.
6594,Harry Potter,cedric.
6595,Cedric Diggory,how are you?
6596,Harry Potter,spectacular.
6597,Cedric Diggory,look i realise i never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons.
6598,Harry Potter,forget about it.
6599,Harry Potter,i'm sure you would have done the same for me.
6600,Cedric Diggory,exactly.
6601,Cedric Diggory,you know the prefects bathroom on the fifth floor?
6602,Cedric Diggory,it's not a bad place for a bath.
6603,Cedric Diggory,just take your egg and mull things over in the hot water.
6604,Harry Potter,i must be out of my mind.
6605,Moaning Myrtle,i'd try putting it in the water if i were you.
6606,Harry Potter,myrtle!
6607,Moaning Myrtle,long time no see.
6608,Moaning Myrtle,i was circling a blocked drain the other day and could swear i saw a bit of polyjuice potion.
6609,Moaning Myrtle,not being a bad boy again are you harry?
6610,Harry Potter,polyjuice potion!
6611,Harry Potter,kicked the habit.
6612,Harry Potter,myrtle did you say try putting it in the water?
6613,Moaning Myrtle,well.
6614,Moaning Myrtle,that's what he did.
6615,Moaning Myrtle,the other boy the handsome one.
6616,Moaning Myrtle,cedric.
6617,Moaning Myrtle,well go on open it.
6618,Merpeople,come seek us where our voices sound.
6619,Merpeople,we cannot sing above the ground.
6620,Merpeople,an hour long you'll have to look to recover what we took.
6621,Harry Potter,myrtle there aren't merpeople in the black lake are there?
6622,Moaning Myrtle,ahhh very good.
6623,Moaning Myrtle,took cedric ages to riddle it out.
6624,Moaning Myrtle,almost all the bubbles were gone...
6625,Hermione Granger,harry tell me again.
6626,Harry Potter,come seek us where our voices sound.
6627,Hermione Granger,the black lake that's obvious.
6628,Harry Potter,an hour long you'll have to look.
6629,Hermione Granger,again obvious though i must admit potentially problematic
6630,Harry Potter,potentially problematic?
6631,Harry Potter,when was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour hermione?
6632,Hermione Granger,look harry we can do this.
6633,Hermione Granger,the three of us can figure it out.
6634,Alastor Moody,hate to break up this scholar session but professor mcgonagall would like to see you in her office.
6635,Alastor Moody,not you potter just weasly and granger.
6636,Hermione Granger,but sir the second task is only hours away and...
6637,Alastor Moody,exactly.
6638,Alastor Moody,presumably potter is well prepared by now and could do with a good night's sleep.
6639,Alastor Moody,go.
6640,Alastor Moody,now!
6641,Alastor Moody,longbottom!
6642,Alastor Moody,why don't you help potter put his books back.
6643,Neville Longbottom,you know if you're interested in plants you'd be better with gorshok's guide to herbology.
6644,Neville Longbottom,do you know there's a wizard in nepal whose growing gravity resistant trees?
6645,Harry Potter,neville.
6646,Harry Potter,no offense but i really don't care about plants.
6647,Harry Potter,now if there's a tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great.
6648,Neville Longbottom,i don't know about a turnip but you can always use gilliweed.
6649,Harry Potter,you're sure about this neville.
6650,Neville Longbottom,absolutely.
6651,Harry Potter,for an hour.
6652,Neville Longbottom,most likely.
6653,Harry Potter,most likely?
6654,Neville Longbottom,well there is some debate among herbologists as to the effects of freshwater versus saltwater.
6655,Harry Potter,you're telling me this now?
6656,Harry Potter,you must be joking.
6657,Neville Longbottom,i just wanted to help.
6658,Harry Potter,well that makes you sight better than ron and hermione.
6659,Harry Potter,where are they anyway?
6660,Neville Longbottom,you seem a little tense harry.
6661,Harry Potter,do i?
6662,Albus Dumbledore,welcome to the second task.
6663,Albus Dumbledore,last night something was stolen from each of our champions.
6664,Albus Dumbledore,a treasure of sorts.
6665,Albus Dumbledore,these four treasures one for each champion now lie on the bottom of the black lake.
6666,Albus Dumbledore,in order to win each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface.
6667,Albus Dumbledore,simple enough.
6668,Albus Dumbledore,except for this they will have one hour to do so and one hour only.
6669,Albus Dumbledore,after that they'll be on their own.
6670,Alastor Moody,put that in your mouth.
6671,Albus Dumbledore,you may begin at the start of the cannon.
6672,Seamus Finnigan,what's the matter with him?
6673,Dean Thomas,i don't know i can't see him.
6674,Neville Longbottom,oh my god i've killed harry potter!
6675,Albus Dumbledore,the beauxbatons champion miss delacour has unfortunately been forced to retire.
6676,Albus Dumbledore,she will take no further part in this task.
6677,Harry Potter,but she's my friend too!
6678,Merpeople,only one.
6679,Albus Dumbledore,harry!
6680,Bartemius Crouch,get him another towel.
6681,Albus Dumbledore,i want all the judges over here now.
6682,Fleur Delacour,you saved her even though she wasn't yours to save.
6683,Fleur Delacour,my little sister!
6684,Fleur Delacour,thank you!
6685,Fleur Delacour,and you... .
6686,Fleur Delacour,you helped!
6687,Ron Weasley,well... yeah... a bit
6688,Ron Weasley,merci.
6689,Hermione Granger,harry!
6690,Harry Potter,hermione
6691,Hermione Granger,are you alright?
6692,Hermione Granger,you must be freezing!
6693,Hermione Granger,personally i think you behaved admirably.
6694,Harry Potter,i finished last hermione.
6695,Hermione Granger,next to last.
6696,Albus Dumbledore,attention!
6697,Albus Dumbledore,attention!
6698,Albus Dumbledore,the winner is... mr diggory!
6699,Albus Dumbledore,for showing unique command of the bubblehead shark.
6700,Albus Dumbledore,the way i see it mr potter would have finished first had it not been for his determination to rescue not only mr weasly but the others as well.
6701,Albus Dumbledore,we've agreed to award him second place!
6702,Albus Dumbledore,for outstanding moral fibre.
6703,Fred Weasley,all that moral fibre eh?
6704,Ron Weasley,blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right.
6705,George Weasley,well done 'moral fibre'.
6706,Bartemius Crouch,congratulations potter fine achievement.
6707,Bartemius Crouch,well done boy.
6708,Bartemius Crouch,i'm sorry we haven't spoken after all your story is one i've heard many times.
6709,Bartemius Crouch,quite remarkable.
6710,Bartemius Crouch,tragic of course to lose one's family.
6711,Bartemius Crouch,never whole again are we?
6712,Bartemius Crouch,still life goes on.
6713,Bartemius Crouch,and here we stand.
6714,Bartemius Crouch,i'm sure your parents would be very proud today potter.
6715,Alastor Moody,bartimus!
6716,Alastor Moody,not trying to lure potter into one of the ministry's summer internships are we?
6717,Alastor Moody,last boy who went into the department of ministries never came out!
6718,Alastor Moody,and they say i'm mad.
6719,Rubeus Hagrid,so i remember i remember when i first met you all.
6720,Rubeus Hagrid,biggest bunch of misfits i've ever set eyes on.
6721,Rubeus Hagrid,always reminded me of myself a little.
6722,Rubeus Hagrid,and here we all are four years later.
6723,Ron Weasley,we're still misfits.
6724,Rubeus Hagrid,maybe.
6725,Rubeus Hagrid,but we've all got each other and harry of course.
6726,Rubeus Hagrid,soon to be!
6727,Rubeus Hagrid,the youngest!
6728,Rubeus Hagrid,tri-wizard champion there's ever been!
6729,Rubeus Hagrid,hooray!
6730,Harry Potter,mr crouch?
6731,Albus Dumbledore,a man has died here.
6732,Albus Dumbledore,and he won't be the last you must take action.
6733,Cornelius Fudge,i will not.
6734,Cornelius Fudge,in times like these the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength dumbledore.
6735,Albus Dumbledore,then for once show them some.
6736,Cornelius Fudge,the tri-wizard tournament will not be cancelled.
6737,Cornelius Fudge,i will not be seen as a coward.
6738,Albus Dumbledore,but surely that is what's right no matter what others think.
6739,Cornelius Fudge,what did you say?
6740,Cornelius Fudge,what did you say to me?
6741,Alastor Moody,excuse me gentlemen it may interest you to know that this conversation is no longer private.
6742,Cornelius Fudge,harry!
6743,Cornelius Fudge,harry how good to see you again.
6744,Harry Potter,i can come back later professor.
6745,Albus Dumbledore,oh not necessary harry the minister and i are done.
6746,Albus Dumbledore,i'll be back in a moment.
6747,Albus Dumbledore,minister after you.
6748,Albus Dumbledore,harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence but i have to warn you they're a little bit sharp.
6749,Harry Potter,agh!
6750,Harry Potter,professor?
6751,Bartemius Crouch,igor karkaroff you have been brought from azkaban at your own request to present evidence to this counsel.
6752,Bartemius Crouch,should your testimony prove consequential.
6753,Bartemius Crouch,counsel may be prepared to order your immediate release.
6754,Bartemius Crouch,until such time you remain in the eyes of the ministry a convicted deatheater.
6755,Bartemius Crouch,do you accept these terms?
6756,Igor Karkaroff,i do sir.
6757,Bartemius Crouch,what do you wish to present?
6758,Igor Karkaroff,i have names sir.
6759,Igor Karkaroff,there was a rosier evan rosier.
6760,Bartemius Crouch,mr rosier is dead.
6761,Igor Karkaroff,dead?
6762,Alastor Moody,yeah took a piece of me with him though didn't he.
6763,Igor Karkaroff,i didn't know.
6764,Bartemius Crouch,if that is all the witness has to offer...
6765,Igor Karkaroff,no!
6766,Igor Karkaroff,no!
6767,Igor Karkaroff,there was rookwood he was a spy.
6768,Bartemius Crouch,augustus rookwood?
6769,Bartemius Crouch,of the department of ministries.
6770,Igor Karkaroff,ya ya the same.
6771,Igor Karkaroff,he passed information to you know who from inside the ministry itself.
6772,Bartemius Crouch,very well.
6773,Bartemius Crouch,counsel will deliberate.
6774,Bartemius Crouch,in the meantime you will be returned to azkaban.
6775,Igor Karkaroff,no!
6776,Igor Karkaroff,wait!
6777,Igor Karkaroff,please!
6778,Igor Karkaroff,i have more.
6779,Igor Karkaroff,snape severus snape.
6780,Albus Dumbledore,the counsel is very much aware you have given evidence on this matter.
6781,Albus Dumbledore,severus snape was indeed a deatheater and prior to lord voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk.
6782,Albus Dumbledore,today he's no more a deatheater than i am.
6783,Igor Karkaroff,it's a lie!
6784,Igor Karkaroff,severus snape remains faithful to the dark lord.
6785,Bartemius Crouch,silence!
6786,Bartemius Crouch,unless the witness possesses any name of genuine consequence this session is now concluded.
6787,Igor Karkaroff,oh no no no no no.
6788,Igor Karkaroff,i heard about one more.

6790,Igor Karkaroff,the name...
6791,Bartemius Crouch,yes?
6792,Igor Karkaroff,i know for a fact this person took part in the capture and by means of the cruciatus curse torture of the aurer frank longbottom and...
6793,Bartemius Crouch,the name!
6794,Bartemius Crouch,give me the wretched name!
6795,Igor Karkaroff,barty crouch!
6796,Igor Karkaroff,... junior.
6797,Bartemius Crouch Junior,get your hands off me you pathetic little men.
6798,Bartemius Crouch Junior,hello father.
6799,Bartemius Crouch,you are no son of mine.
6800,Albus Dumbledore,curiosity's not a sin harry but you should exercise caution.
6801,Albus Dumbledore,it's a pensieve useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched.
6802,Albus Dumbledore,it allows me to see what small things i've already seen.
6803,Albus Dumbledore,you see harry i've searched and searched for something some small detail.
6804,Albus Dumbledore,something i might have overlooked something that would explain why these terrible things have happened.
6805,Albus Dumbledore,every time i get close to an answer it slips away it's maddedning.
6806,Harry Potter,sir mr crouch's son what happened to him?
6807,Albus Dumbledore,he was sent to azkaban.
6808,Albus Dumbledore,destroyed barty to do it.
6809,Albus Dumbledore,but he had no choice the evidence was overwhelming.
6810,Albus Dumbledore,why do you ask?
6811,Harry Potter,it's just that i had a dream about him.
6812,Harry Potter,it was in the summer before school.
6813,Harry Potter,in the dream i was in a house and voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human and wormtail was there too and mr crouch's son.
6814,Albus Dumbledore,have there been other dreams like this?
6815,Harry Potter,yes.
6816,Harry Potter,always the same one.
6817,Harry Potter,sir... these dreams what i see you don't think it's actually happening do you?
6818,Albus Dumbledore,i think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams harry i think it's best that you simply...
6819,Albus Dumbledore,cast them away.
6820,Igor Karkaroff,it's a sign severus you know what it means as well as i.
6821,Severus Snape,potter!
6822,Severus Snape,what's your hurry?
6823,Severus Snape,congratulations your performance in the black lake was inspiring.
6824,Severus Snape,gilliweed am i correct?
6825,Harry Potter,yes sir.
6826,Severus Snape,ingenious.
6827,Severus Snape,a rather rare herb gilliweed not something found in your every day garden.
6828,Severus Snape,nor is this know what it is?
6829,Harry Potter,bubble juice sir?
6830,Severus Snape,veritaserum.
6831,Severus Snape,three drops of this and you-know-who himself will spill his darkest secrets.
6832,Severus Snape,the use of this on a student is regrettably forbidden however should you ever steal from my personal stores again my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice.
6833,Harry Potter,i haven't stolen anything.
6834,Severus Snape,don't lie to me.
6835,Severus Snape,gilliweed might be innocuous but boomslang skin?
6836,Severus Snape,lacewing flies?
6837,Severus Snape,you and your friends are brewing polyjuice potion and believe me i'm going to find out why.
6838,Albus Dumbledore,earlier today professor moody placed the tri-wizards cup deep within the maze.
6839,Albus Dumbledore,only he knows its exact position.
6840,Albus Dumbledore,now as mr diggory...
6841,Albus Dumbledore,and mr potter tied for first position they will be the first to enter the maze.
6842,Albus Dumbledore,followed by mr krum...
6843,Albus Dumbledore,the first person to touch the cup will be the winner.
6844,Albus Dumbledore,i've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter if at any point should a contestant wish to withdraw from the task he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands.
6845,Albus Dumbledore,contestants gather round.
6846,Albus Dumbledore,in the maze you'll find not dragons or creatures of the deep.
6847,Albus Dumbledore,instead you'll face something more challenging.
6848,Albus Dumbledore,you see people change in the maze.
6849,Albus Dumbledore,oh find the cup if you can but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way.
6850,Alastor Moody,champions!
6851,Alastor Moody,prepare yourselves.

6974,Harry Potter,the cup was a portkey.
6975,Harry Potter,someone had bewitched it.
6976,Alastor Moody,what was it like?
6977,Alastor Moody,what was he like?
6978,Harry Potter,who?
6979,Alastor Moody,the dark lord.
6980,Alastor Moody,what was it like to stand in his presence?
6981,Harry Potter,i dunno.
6982,Harry Potter,it was like i'd fallen into one of my dreams.
6983,Harry Potter,one of my nightmares.
6984,Alastor Moody,were there others?
6985,Alastor Moody,in the graveyard were there others?
6986,Harry Potter,um.
6987,Harry Potter,i don't think i said anything about a graveyard professor.
6988,Alastor Moody,marvellous creatures dragons aren't they?
6989,Alastor Moody,do you think that miserable oaf would have led you into the woods if i hadn't suggested it?
6990,Alastor Moody,do you think cedric diggory would have told you to hold the egg under the water if i hadn't have told him first myself?
6991,Alastor Moody,do you think neville longbottom the witless wonder could have provided you with gilliweed if i hadn't have given him the book that led you straight to it?
6992,Alastor Moody,huh?
6994,Harry Potter,it was you from the beginning.
6995,Harry Potter,you put my name in the goblet of fire.
6996,Harry Potter,you bewitched krum.
6997,Harry Potter,but...
6998,Alastor Moody,you won because i made it so potter.
6999,Alastor Moody,you ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so.
7000,Alastor Moody,and now the deed is done.
7001,Alastor Moody,the blood that runs through these veins runs within the dark lord.
7002,Alastor Moody,imagine how he will reward me when he learns that i have once and for all silenced the great harry potter.
7003,Albus Dumbledore,severus...
7004,Albus Dumbledore,do you know who i am?
7005,Alastor Moody,albus dumbledore.
7006,Albus Dumbledore,are you alastor moody?
7007,Albus Dumbledore,are ya?

7010,Albus Dumbledore,is he in this room?
7011,Albus Dumbledore,harry get away from there!
7012,Albus Dumbledore,are you alright alastor?
7013,Alastor Moody,i'm sorry albus.
7014,Harry Potter,that's moody but then who's...?
7015,Severus Snape,polyjuice potion.
7016,Albus Dumbledore,now we know who's been stealing it from your store severus.
7017,Albus Dumbledore,we'll get you up in a minute.
7018,Albus Dumbledore,barty crouch junior.
7019,Bartemius Crouch Junior,i'll show you mine if you show me yours.
7020,Albus Dumbledore,your arm harry.
7021,Bartemius Crouch Junior,you know what this means don't you?
7022,Bartemius Crouch Junior,he's back.
7023,Bartemius Crouch Junior,lord voldemort has returned.
7024,Albus Dumbledore,send an owl to azkaban think they'll find they're missing a prisoner.
7025,Bartemius Crouch Junior,i'll be welcomed back like a hero.
7026,Albus Dumbledore,perhaps.
7027,Albus Dumbledore,personally i've never had much time for heroes.
7028,Albus Dumbledore,today we acknowledge a really terrible loss.
7029,Albus Dumbledore,cedric diggory was as you all know exceptionally hard working intricately fair minded.
7030,Albus Dumbledore,and most importantly a fierce fierce friend.
7031,Albus Dumbledore,i think therefore you have the right to know exactly how he died.
7032,Albus Dumbledore,you see cedric diggory was murdered by lord voldemort.
7033,Albus Dumbledore,the ministry of magic does not wish me to tell you this.
7034,Albus Dumbledore,but not to do so i think would be an insult to his memory.
7035,Albus Dumbledore,now the pain we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me reminds us that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues our hearts beat as one.
7036,Albus Dumbledore,in light of recent events the bonds of friendship we made this year will be more important than ever.
7037,Albus Dumbledore,remember that and cedric diggory will not have died in vain you remember that.
7038,Albus Dumbledore,and we'll celebrate a boy who was kind and honest and brave and true right to the very end.
7039,Albus Dumbledore,i never liked these curtains.
7040,Albus Dumbledore,set them on fire in my fourth year by accident of course.
7041,Albus Dumbledore,i put you in terrible danger this year harry i'm sorry.
7042,Harry Potter,professor when i was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected.
7043,Albus Dumbledore,priori incantatem.
7044,Albus Dumbledore,you saw your parents that night didn't you?
7045,Albus Dumbledore,they reappeared.
7046,Albus Dumbledore,no spell can reawaken the dead harry i trust you know that.
7047,Albus Dumbledore,dark and diffiult times lie ahead.
7048,Albus Dumbledore,soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy.
7049,Albus Dumbledore,but remember this you have friends here.
7050,Albus Dumbledore,you're not alone.

7212,Molly Weasley,harry dear go on upstairs-— quietly if you please.
7213,Molly Weasley,they're all up there.
7214,Hermione Granger,harry!
7215,Ron Weasley,let him breathe hermione!
7216,Hermione Granger,oh harry!
7217,Hermione Granger,we've missed you!
7218,Hermione Granger,are you furious with us i bet you are!
7219,Ron Weasley,good to see you mate.
7220,Hermione Granger,come on inside.
7221,Hermione Granger,sorry we haven't written harry but dumbledore made us promise not to.
7222,Ron Weasley,we wanted to mate we really did but he thought they would get intercepted.
7223,Ron Weasley,there is an awkward silence.
7224,Harry Potter,right.
7225,Ron Weasley,he thought you would be safest there.
7226,Hermione Granger,he was so angry when he heard.
7227,Hermione Granger,it was...scary...
7228,Harry Potter,so why's he keeping me in the dark?
7229,Harry Potter,didn't you bother asking?
7230,Ron Weasley,we've only seen him twice and not for very long.
7231,Ron Weasley,he's really busy.
7232,Harry Potter,so i get to spend the summer with the dursleys while you two are here.
7233,Ron Weasley,it's not that fun mate.
7234,Ron Weasley,mum won't let us anywhere near the meetings.
7235,Harry Potter,you've still been here!
7236,Harry Potter,what's been going on?
7237,Ron Weasley,we've already told you we're not privyed to the meetings.
7238,Ron Weasley,but we do know a few things.
7239,Hermione Granger,some of the order are following known death eaters like lucious malfoy.
7240,Harry Potter,what's this order everyone's talking about?
7241,Hermione Granger,the order of the phoenix.
7242,Hermione Granger,dumbledore started it last time to fight you-know-who.
7243,Hermione Granger,he only reorganized it after last term.
7244,Molly Weasley,you can come down now the meeting's over.
7245,Molly Weasley,arthur-
7246,Sirius Black,well the ministry is furious with you.
7247,Harry Potter,why?
7248,Sirius Black,you'll have to go to an disciplinary meeting tomorrow.
7249,Harry Potter,okay.
7250,Harry Potter,i'm not really hungry.
7251,Harry Potter,i think i'll go to bed.
7252,Sirius Black,you surprise me harry.
7253,Sirius Black,i figured the first thing you'd do is start asking about voldemort.
7254,Harry Potter,i wanted to but i didn't think you'd tell me anything.
7255,Molly Weasley,and that was quite right harry!
7256,Molly Weasley,you're much to young--
7257,Sirius Black,he has a right to know molly.
7258,Molly Weasley,it's not your decision!
7259,Sirius Black,i know what dumbledore said but he needs to know something.
7260,Sirius Black,he's not a child molly.
7261,Molly Weasley,he's not an adult either!
7262,Molly Weasley,i only have harry's best interests at heart.
7263,Sirius Black,he's not your son.
7264,Molly Weasley,who else does he have then?
7265,Sirius Black,he's got me.
7266,Sirius Black,he's like a son to me.
7267,Sirius Black,what do you want to know harry?
7268,Harry Potter,where's voldemort?
7269,Harry Potter,what's he doing?
7270,Sirius Black,he's hiding for the moment because the ministry is ignoring his return and he doesn't want that to change.
7271,Harry Potter,how?
7272,Sirius Black,the last person you-know-who wanted to alert was dumbledore.
7273,Harry Potter,and what's his plan?
7274,Sirius Black,he's building up his army again just like before.
7275,Harry Potter,and you're stopping him from gaining followers?
7276,Remus Lupin,we're doing our best but it's proving to be...difficult.
7277,Sirius Black,you see when the ministry of magic insists that voldemort isn't back.
7278,Harry Potter,but...why?
7279,Remus Lupin,fudge likes being minister of magic.
7280,Remus Lupin,if it turns out that voldemort came back under his watch he'll be sacked.
7281,Harry Potter,but you're telling people right?
7282,Sirius Black,well they think i'm a mass- murderer lupin is a werewolf tonks and arthur would lose their jobs at the ministry...
7283,Remus Lupin,but dumbledore is doing all he can.
7284,Arthur Weasley,if he keeps it up he might end up in azkaban.
7285,Arthur Weasley,and that would give you- know-who a clear field to--
7286,Harry Potter,what?
7287,Sirius Black,you-know-who wants something.
7288,Sirius Black,something he didn't have last time.
7289,Sirius Black,a weapon.
7290,Harry Potter,what kind of weapon?
7291,Remus Lupin,i'm sorry harry we can't say anything more.
7292,Molly Weasley,morning dear!
7293,Molly Weasley,did you have a good sleep?
7294,Harry Potter,no my scar kept hurting.
7295,Harry Potter,yeah...nerves...
7296,Molly Weasley,good luck harry!
7297,Hermione Granger,they'll have to let you off harry... you were defending
7298,Harry Potter,thanks hermione.
7299,Ron Weasley,what does he get a hug for?
7300,Ron Weasley,oh sure that's why.
7301,Ron Weasley,me?
7302,Ron Weasley,jealous?
7303,Ron Weasley,of course not it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other is all...
7304,Hermione Granger,would you like a hug?
7305,Arthur Weasley,well come on harry.
7306,Arthur Weasley,time to go.
7307,Harry Potter,bye.
7308,Arthur Weasley,good good not very many muggles.
7309,Arthur Weasley,well come on harry in we go.

7315,Witch,pleas stand by.
7316,Arthur Weasley,keep close harry!
7317,Arthur Weasley,ah perkins good morn-
7318,Perkins,arthur they've changed the time of potter's hearing.
7319,Arthur Weasley,blast!
7320,Arthur Weasley,dumbledore thought they might try that.
7321,Perkins,it started at eight!
7322,Arthur Weasley,good lord that was five minutes ago!
7323,Arthur Weasley,come on harry!
7324,Witch,department of mysteries.
7325,Harry Potter,department of mysteries?
7326,Arthur Weasley,yep i've got no idea what they get up to in here it's top secret.
7327,Arthur Weasley,come on harry!
7328,Harry Potter,i've been there before...
7329,Arthur Weasley,now harry i find that highly unlikely...
7330,Arthur Weasley,there you are harry in you go...good luck...
7331,Cornelius Fudge,you're late.
7332,Harry Potter,er...sorry.
7333,Cornelius Fudge,no matter the accused will take his seat.
7334,Cornelius Fudge,very well we are ready to begin.
7335,Albus Dumbledore,witness for the defence albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore.
7336,Cornelius Fudge,ah...you...er...got our message that the time had changed did you?
7337,Cornelius Fudge,well.
7338,Cornelius Fudge,the...ah...charges.
7339,Cornelius Fudge,the charges against the accused shall now be read into the record: that the accused did with deliberation and fore-knowledge of the illegality of his actions produce a patronus charm in full sight of a muggle.
7340,Harry Potter,yes.
7341,Harry Potter,yes but-
7342,Cornelius Fudge,within full sight of a muggle?
7343,Harry Potter,yes but-
7344,Susan Bones,you produced a patronus?
7345,Susan Bones,a fully- formed patronus with a clearly- defined shape?
7346,Harry Potter,yes.
7347,Susan Bones,that is most remarkable mr. potter.
7348,Cornelius Fudge,it doesn't matter how impressive it was!
7349,Harry Potter,but i did it because of the dementors!
7350,Susan Bones,what do you mean?
7351,Harry Potter,my cousin and i were attacked by dementors.
7352,Harry Potter,that's why i had to use the patronus to drive them away.
7353,Cornelius Fudge,ah yes yes another cock-and-bull story.
7354,Susan Bones,dementors in little whinging?
7355,Cornelius Fudge,oh come now susan.
7356,Cornelius Fudge,he's clearly lying.
7357,Cornelius Fudge,we haven't got time to-
7358,Cornelius Fudge,very well.
7359,Cornelius Fudge,weasley fetch the witness.
7360,Cornelius Fudge,full name?
7361,Arabella Figg,arabella doreen figg resident of little whinging.
7362,Cornelius Fudge,so...what is your story?
7363,Arabella Figg,i was sitting on my porch when i saw the two dementors gliding towards the two boys.
7364,Susan Bones,what did the dementors look like?
7365,Arabella Figg,well they were big and wore great tattered cloaks.
7366,Susan Bones,anything else?
7367,Arabella Figg,i-i felt them.
7368,Arabella Figg,it was horrible...like i would never be happy again.
7369,Cornelius Fudge,very well you may go.
7370,Cornelius Fudge,not very convincing.
7371,Susan Bones,oh i disagree.
7372,Susan Bones,she described their effects very completely.
7373,Cornelius Fudge,so two dementors just happen to be in little whinging?
7374,Cornelius Fudge,i think not...
7375,Albus Dumbledore,only if the dementors are still taking their orders from only the ministry these days.
7376,Albus Dumbledore,i believe you know my views on this cornelius.
7377,Cornelius Fudge,yes and they're nothing but bilge dumbledore.
7378,Dolores Umbridge,excuse me dumbledore but did you just accused the ministry of magic of ordering an attack on this boy?
7379,Cornelius Fudge,dementors are irrelevant!
7380,Cornelius Fudge,well yes if he's telling the truth!
7381,Cornelius Fudge,very well all for clearing the accused of charges?
7382,Cornelius Fudge,all opposed?
7383,Albus Dumbledore,excellent.
7384,Arthur Weasley,harry you've been let off!
7385,Arthur Weasley,that's wonderful!
7386,Arthur Weasley,you were tried by the full court?
7387,Harry Potter,i think so yeah.
7388,Harry Potter,er...is percy mad at you?
7389,Arthur Weasley,ah...yes...i'm afraid we had a bit of a row.
7390,Arthur Weasley,he well he sided with fudge and the rest of us sided with dumbledore so percy left.
7391,Lucius Malfoy,well well if it isn't patronus potter.
7392,Harry Potter,what are you doing here?
7393,Lucius Malfoy,come now potter i really don't think that private matters between the minister and myself are any concern of yours.
7394,Lucius Malfoy,shall we continue this in your
7395,Cornelius Fudge,certainly.
7396,Harry Potter,if he wanted to talk to the minister why down here?
7397,Arthur Weasley,dunno harry.
7398,Arthur Weasley,some things are just beyond comprehension.
7399,Arthur Weasley,settle down you three!
7400,Arthur Weasley,sirius we saw fudge talking with lucius malfoy on level nine again.
7401,Arthur Weasley,tell dumbledore next time he comes in would you?
7402,Sirius Black,yeah absolutely.
7403,Arthur Weasley,well i'd better be off.
7404,Arthur Weasley,i've got a bewitched vomiting toilet to deal with.
7405,Fred Weasley,george remember that concept.
7406,Fred Weasley,vomiting toilet.
7407,George Weasley,right you are fred.
7408,Arthur Weasley,also i'm covering for tonks on guard duty later tonight so i won't be back until late.
7409,Sirius Black,harry!
7410,Sirius Black,you all right harry?
7411,Harry Potter,yeah...just...my scar...the pain is getting stronger.
7412,Sirius Black,harry i've got something that might interest you.
7413,Sirius Black,this was the original order of the phoenix.
7414,Sirius Black,found it while we were cleaning.
7415,Sirius Black,there's mad-eye and dumbledore right next to dedalus diggle; marlene mckinnon she was killed two weeks after this was taken...;
7416,Sirius Black,then there's frank and alice longbottom tortured into insanity by death eaters; lupin of course..
7417,Harry Potter,my parents.
7418,Harry Potter,i miss them sirius...
7419,Sirius Black,i know harry i know.
7420,Sirius Black,i miss them too.
7421,Sirius Black,it's not fair that i got to spend so much time with them and you didn't...
7422,Harry Potter,why'd they have to die sirius why?
7423,Sirius Black,i know i'm not your father harry but i'll always be there for you if i can help it...
7424,Harry Potter,thanks.
7425,Sirius Black,kreacher get out of here!
7426,Sirius Black,now!
7427,Kreacher,oh how the old mistress would weep to see the traitor in her house...
7428,Harry Potter,who..who was that?
7429,Sirius Black,kreacher.
7430,Sirius Black,he's been alone with the house for years he's gone a bit funny.
7431,Hermione Granger,harry ron and i we've been named house prefects!
7432,Hermione Granger,she hands harry a letter.
7433,Hermione Granger,what about you harry?
7434,Hermione Granger,are you sure?
7435,Hermione Granger,i would have thought you would get one!
7436,Harry Potter,i'm sure.

7438,Harry Potter,so...congratulations ron hermione...
7439,Ron Weasley,come on lets go back downstairs!

7443,Luna Lovegood,i see them too harry.
7444,Harry Potter,er...you are?
7445,Luna Lovegood,luna.
7446,Luna Lovegood,luna lovegood.
7447,Harry Potter,well thanks luna.
7448,Harry Potter,hagrid's cabin looks deserted.
7449,Hermione Granger,i hope he's all right...
7450,Ron Weasley,what if he were still on his...
7451,Ron Weasley,what if he's still on his mission from dumbledore?
7452,Harry Potter,yeah could be.
7453,Albus Dumbledore,i beg a few moments of your attention as i have a few start of term announcements.
7454,Albus Dumbledore,right off our caretaker the good mr. filch has reminded me for what he says is the four-hundred and sixty-second time that he had an annually updated list of various banned items usually introduced by our humour experts fred and george weasley...
7455,Albus Dumbledore,... which are posted in an extensive list on the door to mr. filch's door.
7456,Albus Dumbledore,also we have two staffing changes this year.
7457,Albus Dumbledore,professor grubby-plank will be taking the post of care of magical creatures post as professor hagrid is on...extended leave.
7458,Albus Dumbledore,additionally we have professor umbridge who has kindly agreed to fill the post of defense against the dark arts-—
7459,Dolores Umbridge,hem hem headmaster if i could address the school?
7460,Dolores Umbridge,thank you headmaster.
7461,Dolores Umbridge,now how are we all doing tonight?
7462,Dolores Umbridge,i thought i would just say a few words.
7463,Dolores Umbridge,i am here at the ministry of magic's bequest under educational decree twenty-two which states that if the headmaster of hogwarts is unable to fill any teaching post the ministry shall select one for the position.
7464,Dean Thomas,so why didn't your mum want you to come back to hogwarts seamus?
7465,Harry Potter,what?
7466,Seamus Finnigan,me mam didn't want me to come back to hogwarts...
7467,Harry Potter,why?
7468,Seamus Finnigan,well...because of you...
7469,Harry Potter,what did i do?
7470,Seamus Finnigan,she...well she figure's you're well...you're lying about you-know- who and dumbledore's a right nutter...
7471,Harry Potter,where'd she get that from?
7472,Harry Potter,no one believes me hedwig.
7473,Harry Potter,no one...
7474,Harry Potter,i'm alone...
7475,Harry Potter,sorry professor...
7476,Dolores Umbridge,hmm let's see five points from gryffindor for coming in late.
7477,Dolores Umbridge,now as i was saying before mr. potter interrupted with his antics your defense against the dark arts education has been rather fragmented and disjointed in your past classes hasn't it?
7478,Dolores Umbridge,i will be following a pre-approved ministry-prepared theory-centered defense lesson plan.
7479,Dolores Umbridge,copy this down.
7480,Dolores Umbridge,yes?
7481,Hermione Granger,i wanted to know something about your course aims.
7482,Dolores Umbridge,well they should be perfectly self- evident.
7483,Hermione Granger,but surely the whole point of defense against the dark arts is practical application?
7484,Dolores Umbridge,miss granger this class has been approved by ministry experts.
7485,Dolores Umbridge,are you a ministry expert?
7486,Hermione Granger,no but-
7487,Dolores Umbridge,then you have no business challenging those who are.
7488,Dolores Umbridge,we will be learning about spells in a safe risk-free environment-
7489,Hermione Granger,but we've got o.w.l.s coming up!
7490,Hermione Granger,you expect us to do the spells with no practice?
7491,Harry Potter,what good's theory in the real world?
7492,Harry Potter,what about lord voldemort?
7493,Dolores Umbridge,ten points from gryffindor mr. potter.
7494,Dolores Umbridge,let me set the record straight.
7495,Dolores Umbridge,some of you have been told that a certain dead wizard has returned.
7496,Dolores Umbridge,this is a lie.
7497,Harry Potter,it-is-not-a-lie!
7498,Dolores Umbridge,mr. potter you have just landed yourself in detention!
7499,Harry Potter,so according to you cedric diggory dropped dead?
7500,Harry Potter,or are you calling me a murderer?
7501,Dolores Umbridge,the boy's death was a tragic accident.
7502,Harry Potter,it was murder!
7503,Harry Potter,i saw it happen!
7504,Dolores Umbridge,mr potter you have earned yourself a week's worth of detentions!
7505,Harry Potter,yeah talk to somebody who cares.
7506,Dolores Umbridge,that goes to professor mcgonagall dear.
7507,Harry Potter,yeah.
7508,Harry Potter,but she called me a liar!
7509,Harry Potter,yes professor.
7510,Minerva McGonagall,good.
7511,Minerva McGonagall,off you go.
7512,Hermione Granger,how can dumbledore let that horrible woman teach?
7513,Hermione Granger,and when we're taking our owl tests too!
7514,Ron Weasley,you reckon she's here to spy on us?
7515,Hermione Granger,well not us specifically but definitely dumbledore and the order.
7516,Harry Potter,oh!
7517,Harry Potter,sorry...
7518,Angelina Johnson,yeah well you're going to have to get out of it somehow.
7519,Angelina Johnson,we're holding tryouts for keeper now wood's gone and i wanted to have the whole team there.
7520,Harry Potter,i'll never get out of it angelina.
7521,Angelina Johnson,well just...don't do it again!
7522,Ron Weasley,well harry shall we start on snape's report?
7523,Harry Potter,later i've got detention.
7524,Hermione Granger,good luck harry.
7525,Harry Potter,thanks.
7526,Dolores Umbridge,ah potter.
7527,Dolores Umbridge,sit down.
7528,Dolores Umbridge,you're going to be doing lines tonight mr. potter and you'll be using this quill.
7529,Dolores Umbridge,"you will write ""i will not tell lies"" until i tell you to stop."
7530,Dolores Umbridge,understand?
7531,Harry Potter,there's no ink.
7532,Dolores Umbridge,oh...you won't need ink.
7533,Dolores Umbridge,problem potter?
7534,Dolores Umbridge,that's enough for this evening.
7535,Dolores Umbridge,same time tomorrow and we'll see if we can get the message to sink in a bit deeper.
7536,Hermione Granger,hey harry.
7537,Hermione Granger,have you seen ron?
7538,Hermione Granger,i can't find him anywhere.
7539,Harry Potter,no i haven't.
7540,Hermione Granger,he's been acting fishy all week.
7541,Hermione Granger,he's up to something.
7542,Dolores Umbridge,that's enough for tonight potter.
7543,Dolores Umbridge,let's see that hand.
7544,Ron Weasley,harry!
7545,Ron Weasley,i tried out for quidditch keeper at the tryouts!
7546,Ron Weasley,i'm on the team!
7547,Ron Weasley,harry--bloody hell!
7548,Hermione Granger,he's got to be taken to the hospital wing.
7549,Ron Weasley,you said she was making you do lines!
7550,Harry Potter,she is.
7551,Harry Potter,but the quill has some sort of spell on it.
7552,Harry Potter,it uses blood for ink.
7553,Hermione Granger,that old hag!
7554,Hermione Granger,she's sick!
7555,Harry Potter,no i'm telling anyone.
7556,Hermione Granger,harry i really think you should tell--
7557,Harry Potter,no!
7558,Harry Potter,i don't need his help.
7559,Harry Potter,i don't need anyone's help.
7560,Hermione Granger,hagrid's still not back yet.
7561,Hermione Granger,i hope he's all right.
7562,Harry Potter,i've asked sirius about it.
7563,Hermione Granger,harry you can't write to him!
7564,Hermione Granger,owls are being intercepted it isn't safe.
7565,Harry Potter,don't worry hermione i wrote it in code.
7566,Harry Potter,anyway i figured i need to tell someone about umbridge.
7567,Harry Potter,my scar hurt again last night in detention.
7568,Ron Weasley,always knew she was a bit fishy.
7569,Hermione Granger,you think she's working for you- know-who?
7570,Harry Potter,well it's a possibility isn't it?
7571,Hermione Granger,i suppose so.
7572,Hermione Granger,he could have her under the imperious curse though it's unlikely.
7573,Hermione Granger,dumbledore'd know.
7574,Harry Potter,yeah but dumbledore didn't have a choice did he?
7575,Harry Potter,she'd been sent here by the ministry.
7576,Sybill Trelawney,greetings my children.
7577,Sybill Trelawney,i sense even now that many of you have already made the transition into the beyond!
7578,Sybill Trelawney,today we will be continuing our interpretation of prophetic dreams.
7579,Sybill Trelawney,please divide into your groups and discuss your recent night time visions using the text as a guide.
7580,Dolores Umbridge,and how long have you been at this post?
7581,Dolores Umbridge,i understand you are the descendent of the famous seer cassandra trelawney?
7582,Sybill Trelawney,i am.
7583,Dolores Umbridge,and you are the first since cassandra to have the second sight?
7584,Sybill Trelawney,these things tend to skip...several...generations.
7585,Dolores Umbridge,of course.
7586,Dolores Umbridge,now if you would kindly make a prediction for me?
7587,Dolores Umbridge,the inner eye does not see upon command!
7588,Sybill Trelawney,my dear boy your dream diary if you please!
7589,Sybill Trelawney,my dear boy!
7590,Sybill Trelawney,my poor boy!
7591,Sybill Trelawney,these dreams are evil portends!
7592,Sybill Trelawney,yes yes oatmeal!
7593,Sybill Trelawney,are you telling me you cannot see the signs?
7594,Sybill Trelawney,the foretelling of suffering and death?
7595,Harry Potter,er...
7596,Sybill Trelawney,perhaps you are not as in the beyond as the others.
7597,Dolores Umbridge,well if that's the best you can do professor i will be going.
7598,Harry Potter,where are we going hermione?
7599,Hermione Granger,there we are.
7600,Ron Weasley,"""the hog's head"" hermione?"
7601,Hermione Granger,come on i'll explain in a minute.
7602,Harry Potter,hermione what's going on?
7603,Hermione Granger,these are some people i mentioned my defense against the dark arts idea with.
7604,Harry Potter,you mean about us teaching ourselves?
7605,Neville Longbottom,hey harry.
7606,Harry Potter,hey neville.
7607,Harry Potter,uh...same to you luna.
7608,Fred Weasley,hear hear!
7609,Hermione Granger,obviously this will help us pass our o.w.l.s but more importantly it gives us the ability to protect ourselves from...lord voldemort.
7610,Hermione Granger,several people jump or wince in fear at the name.
7611,Harry Potter,that's the first time you've said his name.
7612,Zacharias Smith,how do we know you-know-who's really back?
7613,George Weasley,dumbledore believes he is.
7614,Justin Finch-Fletchley,you mean dumbledore believes him.
7615,Hermione Granger,that's true but i think we're drifting from the purpose--
7616,Harry Potter,it's okay hermione.
7617,Harry Potter,i believe voldemort's back because i fought him last year.
7618,Harry Potter,dumbledore's already told the school that.
7619,Harry Potter,if you didn't believe him you won't believe anyone.
7620,Hermione Granger,well...anyway...uh i think that in order to learn properly we'll need a teacher.
7621,Neville Longbottom,but we're all students.
7622,Neville Longbottom,none of us has the experience to--
7623,Ginny Weasley,someone here does.
7624,Ginny Weasley,everyone looks at her.
7625,Ginny Weasley,she is staring directly at harry.
7626,Harry Potter,me?
7627,Michael Corner,i for one would like to know why potter's qualified and the rest of us aren't.
7628,Susan Bones,one of the portraits said you'd killed a basilisk in the chamber of secrets with that sword in dumbledore's office.
7629,Harry Potter,uh...well yeah i did.
7630,Lee Jordan,blimey harry...
7631,Lavender Brown,wow...
7632,Fred Weasley,can't forget that he saved the sorcerer's stone from you-know-who in his first year.
7633,Cho Chang,and last year he got through the triwizard tournament!
7634,Ron Weasley,not to mention you dueled with you- know-who all alone and he still couldn't kill you!
7635,Ginny Weasley,and you fought off those dementors that attacked you this summer.
7636,Hermione Granger,so all in favor of taking lessons from harry?
7637,Hermione Granger,where are we going to meet?
7638,Neville Longbottom,what about an unused classroom?
7639,Harry Potter,that might work.
7640,Harry Potter,i'll look into that.
7641,Hermione Granger,ok good.
7642,Hermione Granger,i think we should put our names down so we know who was here.
7643,Ernest Macmillan,i don't know...if it were found...i mean umbridge wouldn't like what we're doing...
7644,Hermione Granger,honestly ernie do you think i'd just leave it lying around?
7645,Hermione Granger,besides its enchanted.
7646,Hermione Granger,also what should we call ourselves?
7647,Angelina Johnson,what about the anti-unbridhe league?
7648,Ginny Weasley,i think it should be dumbledore's army.
7649,Ginny Weasley,there is excited agreement.
7650,Ginny Weasley,harry smiles at her.
7651,Hermione Granger,we'll let you know when we're going
7652,Hermione Granger,i think that went well.
7653,Harry Potter,yeah.
7654,Hermione Granger,and did you see cho harry?
7655,Hermione Granger,well she couldn't keep her eyes off you could she?
7657,Angelina Johnson,harry you won't believe...that umbridge woman...this is too much!
7659,Harry Potter,what's she done now?
7660,Angelina Johnson,follow me.
7661,Harry Potter,"""by order of the hogwarts high inquisitor: all student organizations societies teams groups and clubs are henceforth disbanded."
7662,Harry Potter,permission to reform must be approved by high inquisitor umbridge.
7663,Harry Potter,no student organization can exist without the knowledge and approval of the high inquisitor.
7664,Harry Potter,"any student found to be a part of an illegal organization will be expelled immediately."""
7665,Angelina Johnson,she refused to allow us to reform the gryffindor team.
7666,Angelina Johnson,we had to go to dumbledore to get her to allow it.
7667,Harry Potter,not only that but what about the
7668,Harry Potter,this isn't a coincidence.
7669,Harry Potter,she knows.
7670,Ron Weasley,she can't!
7671,Harry Potter,look we don't know how many people could have overheard our meeting and told her.
7672,Ron Weasley,or somebody at the meeting could have blabbed to her.
7673,Hermione Granger,no they couldn't have.
7674,Hermione Granger,the parchment we all signed was enchanted like i said.
7675,Hermione Granger,no one can betray the d.a.
7676,Hermione Granger,without us knowing.
7677,Harry Potter,what would we do without you hermione?
7678,Harry Potter,hedwig!
7679,Hermione Granger,she's hurt!
7680,Ron Weasley,she doesn't look very good.
7681,Hermione Granger,harry you'd better take her to professor grubby-plank.
7682,Hermione Granger,she'll know what to do.
7683,Minerva McGonagall,potter!
7684,Minerva McGonagall,where on earth are you going at this time of night?
7685,Harry Potter,it's hedwig.
7686,Harry Potter,i think she's been attacked.
7687,Minerva McGonagall,what?
7688,Minerva McGonagall,yes i think you might be right potter.
7689,Minerva McGonagall,she looks at harry.
7690,Harry Potter,london.
7691,Minerva McGonagall,well give her to me.
7692,Minerva McGonagall,i'll run her
7693,Minerva McGonagall,there you are.
7694,Minerva McGonagall,bear in mind potter that channels of communication in and out of hogwarts are being watched won't you?
7695,Harry Potter,yes professor.
7696,Minerva McGonagall,good.
7697,Minerva McGonagall,now off to bed.
7698,Dobby,mr. harry potter!
7699,Harry Potter,dobby!
7700,Harry Potter,what are you doing here?
7701,Dobby,dobby is cleaning sir.
7702,Harry Potter,what is it dobby.
7703,Dobby,dobby...dobby wishes he could help harry potter.
7704,Dobby,dobby has heard him muttering in his sleep.
7705,Harry Potter,don't worry about it dobby.
7706,Harry Potter,but i don't think you can help me.
7707,Harry Potter,actually there is something you can do dobby.
7708,Harry Potter,i need a room where twenty-eight people can practice defense against the dark arts without the teachers knowing.
7709,Harry Potter,especially professor umbridge.
7710,Dobby,dobby knows of the perfect place harry potter!
7711,Dobby,it is the room of requirement sir.
7712,Dobby,you can only use the room in times of great need.
7713,Dobby,whatever you need will be there for you harry potter.
7714,Harry Potter,that's brilliant dobby!
7715,Dobby,dobby can show you now if you wish harry potter.
7716,Harry Potter,better not dobby.
7717,Harry Potter,school is pretty intense right now.
7718,Harry Potter,we'll do it ina few months before the holidays.
7719,Lee Jordan,...and slytherin is up forty to ten.
7720,Lee Jordan,alica with the quaffle!
7721,Students,weasley is our king weasley is our king he always lets the quaffle in weasley is our king!
7722,Harry Potter,just ignore them ron!
7723,Draco Malfoy,i should thank you weasley.
7724,Draco Malfoy,you're definitely our best player!
7725,Hermione Granger,harry are you all right?
7726,Draco Malfoy,bet you loved that potter!
7727,Draco Malfoy,saved weasley's neck didn't you?
7728,Draco Malfoy,i've never seen a worse keeper!
7729,Draco Malfoy,maybe we should add some more verses to our little song.
7730,Draco Malfoy,about his filthy mother!
7731,Draco Malfoy,and his pathetic loser of a father too!
7732,Draco Malfoy,but then you like the weasleys don't you?
7733,Draco Malfoy,how can you stand the stink?
7734,Draco Malfoy,i guess it reminds you of your own dear mother!
7735,Rolanda Hooch,impedimenta!
7736,Rolanda Hooch,don't make me stupify you potter!
7737,Minerva McGonagall,my office.
7738,Minerva McGonagall,now.
7739,Minerva McGonagall,in all my thirty-nine years at this school i have never seen such a disgusting display.
7740,Harry Potter,malfoy provoked us.
7741,Minerva McGonagall,of course he wanted to provoke you!
7742,Minerva McGonagall,he'd just lost!
7743,Minerva McGonagall,i cannot express in words the disappointment i feel right now.
7744,Minerva McGonagall,what is it dolores?
7745,Dolores Umbridge,i thought you might need some additional authority in dealing with these two.
7746,Minerva McGonagall,you thought wrong.
7747,Minerva McGonagall,now kindly remove yourself from my office.
7748,Minerva McGonagall,now i don't care what malfoy said.
7749,Minerva McGonagall,your performance out there was shameful.
7750,Minerva McGonagall,fifty points from gryffindor and i'm giving you both a week's worth of detentions.
7751,Dolores Umbridge,i hardly think that's an adequate punishment for this.
7752,Dolores Umbridge,educational decree twenty-five.
7753,Dolores Umbridge,it gives me as high inquisitor the power to give punishments and privileges and to alter those given out to students by other members of the staff.
7754,Dolores Umbridge,so i think a life-long ban from playing quidditch should do the trick for both of these.
7755,Dolores Umbridge,oh and this one's twin as well.
7756,Dolores Umbridge,he was going to attack malfoy as well.
7757,Harry Potter,ban us...for life.
7758,Dolores Umbridge,yes indeed mr. potter.
7759,Dolores Umbridge,ah i'll take your brooms as well.
7760,Dolores Umbridge,well have a wonderful day.
7761,Harry Potter,you've--!
7762,Minerva McGonagall,my hands are tied potter.
7763,Angelina Johnson,i can't believe it...three players banned for life in one day...
7764,Ron Weasley,i'm going to resign.
7765,Harry Potter,you can't!
7766,Ron Weasley,i'm horrible!
7767,Ron Weasley,i should never have joined.
7768,Harry Potter,if you quit we'll be out four players!
7769,Ron Weasley,this is the worst day of my life.
7770,Hermione Granger,i know something that could cheer you up.
7771,Hermione Granger,hagrid's back!
7772,Harry Potter,hagrid what happened to you?
7773,Rubeus Hagrid,i've fine i tell yeh!
7774,Ron Weasley,come off it hagrid!
7775,Ron Weasley,we're not blind!
7776,Rubeus Hagrid,can' answer tha' i'm afraid.
7777,Rubeus Hagrid,top secret that is.
7778,Rubeus Hagrid,business of the order.
7779,Harry Potter,we know you were looking for giants hagrid.
7780,Harry Potter,dumbledore said so last year.
7781,Rubeus Hagrid,oh.
7782,Rubeus Hagrid,well yeah i was then.
7783,Rubeus Hagrid,went with madame maxime.
7784,Rubeus Hagrid,took us a month to get to their camp.
7785,Ron Weasley,a month?
7786,Rubeus Hagrid,o' course!
7787,Rubeus Hagrid,can' do magic not with the ministry followin' us all the way.
7788,Rubeus Hagrid,plus giants aren't fond o' wizards.
7789,Rubeus Hagrid,don' trust 'em.
7790,Harry Potter,so what did you do when you found them?
7791,Ron Weasley,so...no giants are coming?
7792,Rubeus Hagrid,well not righ' away.
7793,Rubeus Hagrid,we brought our message an' i expec' a fair few'll remember it afore teh end comes.
7794,Harry Potter,glad to see all of you could find this place all right.
7795,Neville Longbottom,hey harry what is all this stuff?
7796,Harry Potter,loads of defense against the dark arts equipment.
7797,Harry Potter,hopefully we'll be able to get to all of it before the end of term.
7798,Zacharias Smith,oh please.
7799,Zacharias Smith,professor lockhart taught us that in second year.
7800,Ron Weasley,lockhart didn't teach as much as prune himself.
7801,Harry Potter,besides it works.
7802,Harry Potter,i used it against you-know-who last june.
7803,Harry Potter,it saved my life.
7804,Harry Potter,right.
7805,Harry Potter,well let's split into pairs and give it a go.
7806,Neville Longbottom,expelliarmus!
7807,Harry Potter,well done neville!
7808,Harry Potter,look here you lot!
7809,Harry Potter,neville's really got the hang of this one.
7810,Neville Longbottom,expelliarmus!
7811,Neville Longbottom,i did it!
7812,Neville Longbottom,i did it!
7813,Harry Potter,never forget this spell neville.
7814,Harry Potter,it could save your live some day.
7815,Harry Potter,okay everyone.
7816,Harry Potter,we've done a lot today and i've seen some great improvement.
7817,Harry Potter,that's it for now.
7818,Harry Potter,we'll meet back here same time next week!
7819,Neville Longbottom,what's wrong with him?
7820,Ron Weasley,get mcgonagall!
7821,Ron Weasley,go!
7822,Ron Weasley,harry!
7823,Ron Weasley,harry!
7824,Minerva McGonagall,potter!
7825,Minerva McGonagall,wake up potter.
7826,Minerva McGonagall,wake up.
7827,Minerva McGonagall,please...
7828,Harry Potter,mr. weasley's been attacked!
7829,Minerva McGonagall,you dreamed this potter?
7830,Harry Potter,no i saw it happen!
7831,Harry Potter,i...i was there...
7832,Minerva McGonagall,you're sure this happened potter?
7833,Minerva McGonagall,we're going to see the headmaster potter.
7834,Albus Dumbledore,professor mcgonagall and...ah...
7835,Albus Dumbledore,what can i do for you?
7836,Minerva McGonagall,well potter has had some kind of nightmare...
7837,Albus Dumbledore,how did you see this?
7838,Albus Dumbledore,how were you positioned when you saw it?
7839,Harry Potter,oh.
7840,Harry Potter,uh...i was the snake.
7841,Harry Potter,i saw it from the snake's perspective.
7842,Albus Dumbledore,is arthur seriously injured?
7843,Harry Potter,yes!
7844,Albus Dumbledore,you were listening?
7845,Everard,naturally.
7846,Albus Dumbledore,raise the alarm.
7847,Albus Dumbledore,we must make sure arthur is found by the right people.
7848,Albus Dumbledore,many of our previous headmasters and mistresses have portraits in other institutions allowing them to move between them.
7849,Albus Dumbledore,fawkes we will need a warning.
7850,Albus Dumbledore,naturally naturally.
7851,Albus Dumbledore,what news?
7852,Everard,i shouted until someone came.
7853,Everard,they carried him up seconds ago.
7854,Everard,he doesn't look good.
7855,Everard,covered in blood...
7856,Dilys Derwent,dumbledore i've just seen them arrive at st. mungos.
7857,Dilys Derwent,apperated there moments ago.
7858,Dilys Derwent,he looks really bad.
7859,Albus Dumbledore,good.
7860,Albus Dumbledore,minerva the rest of the weasleys will need to be awoken.
7861,Albus Dumbledore,phineas.
7862,Albus Dumbledore,phineas i need you to visit your other portrait.
7863,Albus Dumbledore,tell sirius what happened and that we are coming to stay for a while.
7864,Phineas,it's late dumbledore...
7865,Phineas,i'm going i'm going...
7866,Severus Snape,sit potter.
7867,Severus Snape,as you are well aware i will be teaching you occlumency.
7868,Severus Snape,the headmaster feels you should learn this form of magic to defend yourself against the dark lord who is skilled at legilimency.
7869,Harry Potter,what's that professor?
7870,Severus Snape,legilimency is the ability to extract thoughts and feelings from others.
7871,Harry Potter,voldemort can read minds?
7872,Severus Snape,as usual you have all the subtlety of a stone wall potter.
7873,Severus Snape,the mind is not a book of which any page can be examined.
7874,Severus Snape,the mind is complex and multi-layered.
7875,Harry Potter,so he could read our minds right now?
7876,Harry Potter,but hasn't it helped so far?
7877,Harry Potter,i mean it saved mr. weasley's life didn't it?
7878,Severus Snape,yes it did but at the expense of our advantage.
7879,Severus Snape,the connection between you was so powerful during your vision of the snake that the dark lord became aware of it.
7880,Severus Snape,the headmaster fears that he may try to use this to his advantage to manipulate you through false visions.
7881,Severus Snape,wand out potter.
7882,Severus Snape,you may use any spell you can think of to try and repel me.
7883,Harry Potter,what are you going to do?
7884,Severus Snape,i am going to break into your mind.
7885,Harry Potter,no!
7886,Severus Snape,well you stopped me eventually.
7887,Severus Snape,ideally you should repel me with your mind.
7888,Severus Snape,clear your mind potter.
7889,Severus Snape,abandon
7890,Arthur Weasley,come on harry!
7891,Harry Potter,i've been there before...
7892,Severus Snape,what was that?
7893,Harry Potter,i've just realized...
7894,Severus Snape,realized what potter?
7895,Harry Potter,what's in the department of mysteries sir?
7896,Severus Snape,what did you say?
7897,Harry Potter,that corridor i've been dreaming about it for months...it leads to the department of mysteries i'm sure of it.
7898,Severus Snape,there are many things in the department of mysteries potter none of which concern you.
7899,Dolores Umbridge,i can do whatever i wish!
7900,Sybill Trelawney,this is my home!
7901,Dolores Umbridge,not anymore.
7902,Dolores Umbridge,now remove yourself from this castle!
7903,Dolores Umbridge,i have the authority headmaster!
7904,Albus Dumbledore,oh i agree with you professor umbridge.
7905,Albus Dumbledore,you do have the power to dismiss my teachers.
7906,Albus Dumbledore,however...
7907,Albus Dumbledore,-..-you cannot send them from this
7908,Dolores Umbridge,and what of her quarters when i appoint a new teacher.
7909,Albus Dumbledore,happily that will not be necessary.
7910,Albus Dumbledore,i have found a successor
7911,Albus Dumbledore,...the ministry can only appoint new teachers if i cannot find one.
7912,Albus Dumbledore,i think you will find him suitable enough.
7913,Albus Dumbledore,this is firenze.
7914,Ron Weasley,so you're saying this weapon you- know-who's after is in the department of mysteries?
7915,Harry Potter,it's got to be.
7916,Hermione Granger,that's got to be what surgis podmore was doing in the ministry when he was arrested.
7917,Harry Potter,probably.
7918,Harry Potter,mr. weasley was probably there when he was attacked too.
7919,Harry Potter,that must be what the order's guarding!
7920,Ron Weasley,but why the department of mysteries?
7921,Hermione Granger,it makes perfect sense ron.
7922,Hermione Granger,it's got to be something the ministry's been developing.
7923,Hermione Granger,something top secret.
7924,Hermione Granger,look at this.
7925,Hermione Granger,there's been a mass escape from azkaban.
7926,Ron Weasley,bloody hell!
7927,Harry Potter,they're all death eaters!
7928,Hermione Granger,yes.
7929,Harry Potter,voldemort.
7930,Dolores Umbridge,since i had received information some time ago that potter and a number of other students had met in the hog's head to start an illegal group--
7931,Albus Dumbledore,i'm not sure that's true professor.
7932,Dolores Umbridge,i'm sorry?
7933,Albus Dumbledore,in point of fact when young potter met those students it was not illegal.
7934,Dolores Umbridge,but two days later educational decree twenty-four was introduced.
7935,Albus Dumbledore,again quite correct.
7936,Albus Dumbledore,however i wonder if you have any evidence that proves this group has been meeting since then?
7937,Dolores Umbridge,i have a witness right here!
7938,Albus Dumbledore,correct again.
7939,Albus Dumbledore,i must confess that i was however under the impression that this young girl only told you a meeting was going on tonight.
7940,Dolores Umbridge,let's ask her shall we?
7941,Dolores Umbridge,you can shake your head for an
7942,Dolores Umbridge,what do you mean by shaking your head girl?
7943,Dolores Umbridge,but what about potter?
7944,Dolores Umbridge,he was the
7945,Dolores Umbridge,why are you shaking your head girl?
7946,Albus Dumbledore,again i cannot have you manhandling my students professor umbridge.
7947,Dolores Umbridge,my apologies headmaster.
7948,Dolores Umbridge,i forgot myself.
7949,Cornelius Fudge,well what about the meeting tonight?
7950,Cornelius Fudge,so dumbledore you've been behind this whole thing.
7951,Albus Dumbledore,well minister.
7952,Albus Dumbledore,you've caught me.
7953,Cornelius Fudge,this has all been your doing!
7954,Cornelius Fudge,you've been recruiting students for your army!
7955,Albus Dumbledore,quite correct cornelius.
7956,Cornelius Fudge,i knew it!
7957,Cornelius Fudge,i knew it!
7958,Cornelius Fudge,you've been plotting against me all this time!
7959,Cornelius Fudge,this is too good to be true!
7960,Harry Potter,professor no!
7961,Albus Dumbledore,quiet harry!
7962,Cornelius Fudge,yes shut up potter.
7963,Cornelius Fudge,so you'll be coming with us to the ministry--
7964,Albus Dumbledore,ah yes.
7965,Albus Dumbledore,i was wondering when we'd hit that little snag.
7966,Cornelius Fudge,i see no snag dumbledore.
7967,Albus Dumbledore,but i do.
7968,Albus Dumbledore,you seem to be laboring under the delusion that i would 'come quietly.'
7969,Cornelius Fudge,resisting arrest now are you dumbledore?
7970,Cornelius Fudge,you would really take on two aurors dolores and myself dumbledore?
7971,Albus Dumbledore,naturally.
7972,Albus Dumbledore,all of you did rather well on your spellwork at this school but if you attempt to take me in by force i'm afraid i shall have to hurt you.
7973,Albus Dumbledore,are you all right?
7974,Minerva McGonagall,yes we're fine.
7975,Albus Dumbledore,i'm not going into hiding.
7976,Albus Dumbledore,fudge will soon regret removing me from hogwarts.
7977,Harry Potter,i'm so sorry professor!
7978,Albus Dumbledore,it's fine.
7979,Albus Dumbledore,now listen to me harry.
7980,Albus Dumbledore,keep studying occlumency!
7981,Albus Dumbledore,do everything professor snape tells you.
7982,Albus Dumbledore,close your mind!
7983,Albus Dumbledore,you will understand in time.
7984,Albus Dumbledore,fudge is stirring.
7985,Albus Dumbledore,lay back down.
7986,Albus Dumbledore,they must not think we have had time to talk.
7987,Cornelius Fudge,find him!
7988,Dolores Umbridge,"""by order of the ministry of magic: dolores jane umbridge will replace albus dumbledore as head of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry."""
7989,Dolores Umbridge,my first act as your new headmistress is to form an inquisitional squad lead by draco malfoy.
7990,Dolores Umbridge,they will report directly to me about the goings on in the halls of this school.
7991,Dolores Umbridge,furthermore our good caretaker mr. filch has requested we reinstate the 'old punishments.'
7992,Dolores Umbridge,i have decided that there is no reason we shouldn't.
7993,Harry Potter,are you sure you can't?
7994,Harry Potter,hagrid said it was important.
7995,Ron Weasley,no way.
7996,Ron Weasley,quidditch practice.
7997,Ron Weasley,if i don't show up angelina'll go mad.
7998,Hermione Granger,hagrid...we've been walking for a good hour.
7999,Rubeus Hagrid,its jus' up ahead here.

8098,Voldemort,i'm going to enjoy this black.
8099,Voldemort,i have you and soon i shall have the weapon.
8100,Voldemort,and then not even your pathetic order can stand in my way!
8101,Voldemort,voldemort laughs a horrible spine-chilling laugh.
8102,Griselda Marchbanks,are you all right potter?
8103,Griselda Marchbanks,pressure of exams.
8104,Griselda Marchbanks,it happens.
8105,Griselda Marchbanks,take a breath and maybe you'll be ready to go back in.
8106,Griselda Marchbanks,time is nearly up but--—
8107,Harry Potter,no--no i've done all i can.
8108,Ron Weasley,you all right?
8109,Harry Potter,voldemort!
8110,Harry Potter,he's got sirius!
8111,Harry Potter,in the department of mysteries!
8112,Hermione Granger,how do you know?
8113,Harry Potter,i just saw it.
8114,Harry Potter,how're we going to get there?
8115,Ron Weasley,to the department of mysteries?
8116,Harry Potter,we've got to do something!
8117,Hermione Granger,how'd voldemort get into the ministry of magic without being seen?
8118,Hermione Granger,i mean he and sirius are the two most wanted wizards in the world...
8119,Ron Weasley,yeah.
8120,Ron Weasley,they can't just waltz into the ministry of magic!
8121,Hermione Granger,it just seems so unlikely harry!
8122,Harry Potter,i won't let sirius die!
8123,Ginny Weasley,we heard harry yelling.
8124,Ginny Weasley,what's up?
8125,Harry Potter,voldemort's broken into the department of mysteries.
8126,Harry Potter,he's got sirius there!
8127,Hermione Granger,think harry!
8128,Hermione Granger,voldemort knows you!
8129,Hermione Granger,he knows you'd rush off to save sirius.
8130,Harry Potter,there isn't anyone else hermione!
8131,Harry Potter,everyone from the order is gone!
8132,Ginny Weasley,anything we can do to help?
8133,Harry Potter,no there isn't!
8134,Hermione Granger,yes they can harry.
8135,Harry Potter,how?
8136,Hermione Granger,before we do anything we need to establish that sirius really isn't at headquarters.
8137,Hermione Granger,which means we'll need to break into umbridge's office.
8138,George Weasley,might be able to.
8139,Fred Weasley,just give us a few seconds.
8140,Hermione Granger,mind you it's got to be really good!
8141,Fred Weasley,it's been too quiet around here
8142,George Weasley,time we did some real damage to this place.
8143,Hermione Granger,we'll also need to keep everyone away from her office.
8144,Ginny Weasley,we can do that!
8145,Ginny Weasley,me and luna'll guard the hallway.
8146,Hermione Granger,we'll probably only manage five minutes or so.
8147,Harry Potter,that's all we'll need.
8148,Fred Weasley,right.
8149,Fred Weasley,you've got ten minutes to get to umbridge's office.
8150,Fred Weasley,and whatever you do stay away from the astronomy tower for the next couple of hours.
8151,George Weasley,unless they spread in which case i'd get out of the castle for a while.
8152,Hermione Granger,break out your invisibility cloak harry.
8153,Argus Filch,professor!
8154,Argus Filch,it's those weasley twins!
8155,Argus Filch,they've set something off in the astronomy tower!
8156,Dolores Umbridge,ready to try out the old punishments again?
8157,Harry Potter,grimmauld place!
8158,Fred Weasley,that was worth it!
8159,Argus Filch,i've got you now!
8160,Fred Weasley,thank you for playing one and all.
8161,George Weasley,and now we've got to go!
8162,Harry Potter,sirius!
8163,Harry Potter,lupin?

8165,Kreacher,what's this?
8166,Kreacher,the potter boy in the fire...
8167,Harry Potter,kreacher where's sirius?
8168,Kreacher,master went out.
8169,Dolores Umbridge,so turning a hallway into a swamp is funny is it?
8170,Fred Weasley,fairly amusing yeah.
8171,Dolores Umbridge,well now you're going to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school.
8172,Fred Weasley,this was never your school!
8173,Fred Weasley,hogwarts is dumbledore's school!

8178,George Weasley,completely fred.
8179,Fred Weasley,time to enter the real world?
8180,George Weasley,definitely.

8183,Fred Weasley,we won't be seeing you.
8184,George Weasley,yeah don't bother writing.
8185,Fred Weasley,be sure to visit us at our new premises on diagon alley!
8186,Harry Potter,you know where he is don't you?
8187,Kreacher,master does not tell kreacher where he goes.
8188,Kreacher,master will never return from the department of mysteries!
8189,Dolores Umbridge,you think you could simply walk into my office without me knowing about it?
8190,Dolores Umbridge,foolish boy!
8191,Dolores Umbridge,accio wand!
8192,Dolores Umbridge,who were you trying to contact?
8193,Harry Potter,it's none of your business.
8194,Dolores Umbridge,draco would you fetch professor snape please?
8195,Dolores Umbridge,very well potter.
8196,Dolores Umbridge,i have been patient enough with you.
8197,Severus Snape,you wished to see me?

8204,Severus Snape,potter if i want nonsense shouted at me i shall inform you.

8206,Severus Snape,umbridge is enraged.
8207,Dolores Umbridge,we've played nicely potter.
8208,Dolores Umbridge,you
8209,Dolores Umbridge,you could have saved me a lot of trouble if those dementors i sent to your house had finished you off!

8212,Dolores Umbridge,someone had to act!

8248,Draco Malfoy,god i can't wait until all you weasleys have been expelled.
8249,Draco Malfoy,your stench has been fouling this castle for too long.
8250,Ron Weasley,shut up malfoy!

8252,Draco Malfoy,you know you weasleys are just as bad as mudbloods!

8264,Ron Weasley,so how do we get to the ministry?
8265,Hermione Granger,i'd imagine we should fly.
8266,Harry Potter,we've got no brooms.
8267,Luna Lovegood,there are other ways to fly.
8268,Luna Lovegood,i mean they can fly and they're
8269,Harry Potter,what are those?

8285,Harry Potter,where is everyone?
8286,Ginny Weasley,the ministry closed a half-hour ago.
8287,Ginny Weasley,i expect they all went home.
8288,Harry Potter,that's how voldemort got in unnoticed.
8289,Harry Potter,this is it.
8290,Harry Potter,come on.
8291,Harry Potter,stay close.
8292,Ginny Weasley,now where?
8293,Harry Potter,i don't understand.

8296,Harry Potter,yeah.
8297,Harry Potter,i'll know the way when i see it.
8298,Harry Potter,who's there?
8299,Harry Potter,sirius?
8300,Hermione Granger,there's no one here harry.
8301,Hermione Granger,this isn't the right room.
8302,Harry Potter,does anyone else hear that?
8303,Luna Lovegood,i do.
8304,Luna Lovegood,it's coming from the veil.
8305,Luna Lovegood,there are people in there!
8306,Ron Weasley,what do you mean people?
8307,Hermione Granger,harry i think we should leave.
8308,Harry Potter,sirius...yeah...
8309,Harry Potter,alohomora!
8310,Harry Potter,whatever's in there the ministry sure doesn't want anyone getting to it.
8311,Harry Potter,this is it!
8312,Harry Potter,come on!
8313,Harry Potter,this is it.
8314,Harry Potter,this is where sirius is!
8315,Harry Potter,he's in here somewhere.
8316,Hermione Granger,i don't think sirius is here.
8317,Ron Weasley,harry have you seen this?
8318,Ron Weasley,er...it's got your name on it.
8319,Harry Potter,what's my name doing here?
8320,Hermione Granger,don't touch it harry!
8321,Harry Potter,why not?
8322,Neville Longbottom,yeah harry don't.
8323,Harry Potter,it's got my name on it!
8324,Lucius Malfoy,i warned you before that one day you would come to a sticky end potter.
8325,Harry Potter,where's sirius?
8326,Lucius Malfoy,we don't have him if that's what you mean.
8327,Lucius Malfoy,harry is stunned.
8328,Lucius Malfoy,the dark lord knows your weakness for heroics potter.
8329,Lucius Malfoy,all it took was a little nudge to get you here.
8330,Lucius Malfoy,now give me that prophesy.
8331,Harry Potter,what prophesy?
8332,Lucius Malfoy,that prophesy.
8333,Lucius Malfoy,now hand it over or we'll have to use wands on you.
8334,Harry Potter,go ahead.
8335,Lucius Malfoy,very brave of you potter.
8336,Lucius Malfoy,or are you foolish?
8337,Harry Potter,come and find out!
8338,Lucius Malfoy,really potter.
8339,Lucius Malfoy,you expect to defeat all of us with your little school friends?
8340,Lucius Malfoy,now hand it over and they won't have to die here.
8341,Bellatrix Lestrange,i haven't escaped from azkaban for this!
8342,Lucius Malfoy,no!
8343,Lucius Malfoy,if the prophesy is smashed--
8344,Bellatrix Lestrange,take the youngest girl.
8345,Bellatrix Lestrange,we'll see how committed potter is as we torture her.
8346,Harry Potter,you even try to take her and i'll smash this thing.
8347,Harry Potter,so what kind of prophesy are we talking about here?
8348,Bellatrix Lestrange,surely you jest potter?
8349,Harry Potter,not really.
8350,Harry Potter,how come voldemort wants it?
8351,Lucius Malfoy,you dare to speak the dark lord's name?
8352,Bellatrix Lestrange,silence!
8353,Bellatrix Lestrange,how dare you utter that name from your half—-blood mouth!
8354,Harry Potter,hey did you know voldemort's a half-blood too?
8355,Lucius Malfoy,control yourself bellatrix!
8356,Harry Potter,what's so special about this
8357,Lucius Malfoy,you mean dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden here?
8358,Harry Potter,what?
8359,Lucius Malfoy,so that's what took you so long.
8360,Lucius Malfoy,we wondered.
8361,Lucius Malfoy,only a person for whom the prophesy was made can remove it from its self potter and the dark lord certainly couldn't get it himself.
8362,Harry Potter,so he used me to do his dirty work did he?
8363,Harry Potter,now!
8364,Hermione Granger,stupify!
8365,Lucius Malfoy,stop them!
8366,Hermione Granger,colloportus!
8367,Harry Potter,where'd the rest go?
8368,Hermione Granger,harry they went the wrong way!
8369,Death Eater,they might have gone on to the hall.

8449,Harry Potter,it got smashed by accident!
8450,Bellatrix Lestrange,you lie!
8451,Harry Potter,how's voldemort going to like that?
8452,Harry Potter,you've failed him and he's not very forgiving is he?
8453,Bellatrix Lestrange,forgive me master!
8454,Bellatrix Lestrange,i tried i--
8455,Harry Potter,he can't hear you from here you know!
8456,Voldemort,so you smashed my prophesy...
8457,Voldemort,i grow tired of you continually thwarting my plans harry potter!
8458,Voldemort,avada kadavra!
8459,Albus Dumbledore,you should not have come here tonight tom.
8460,Voldemort,it is you who made that mistake dumbledore!
8461,Voldemort,avada kedavra!
8462,Voldemort,you do not seek to kill me dumbledore?
8463,Albus Dumbledore,there are other ways to destroy a man tom.
8464,Voldemort,there is nothing worse than death!
8465,Albus Dumbledore,you are quite wrong tom as you have always been.
8466,Harry Potter,look out!
8467,Harry Potter,professor!
8468,Albus Dumbledore,stay where you are harry!
8469,Albus Dumbledore,harry!
8470,Albus Dumbledore,are you all right harry?
8471,Percy Weasley,minister i saw him!
8472,Percy Weasley,you-know-who!
8473,Percy Weasley,he was right there!
8474,Cornelius Fudge,i know...i saw him too...
8475,Albus Dumbledore,if you and your men will proceed to the death room you will find several death eaters which i and some others have apprehended.
8476,Cornelius Fudge,seize him!
8477,Albus Dumbledore,minister you have just seen you- know-who in the flesh only seconds ago!
8478,Albus Dumbledore,it is time to come to your senses!
8479,Albus Dumbledore,if you insist on trying to arrest me i am perfectly willing demonstrate how useless such an attempt will be.
8480,Cornelius Fudge,dumbledore what the blazes happened here?
8481,Albus Dumbledore,i will explain everything minister.
8482,Albus Dumbledore,just as soon as i return harry to school.
8483,Cornelius Fudge,what's he doing here?
8484,Cornelius Fudge,and what's happened to him?
8485,Albus Dumbledore,minister you will order the removal of dolores umbridge from my school.
8486,Albus Dumbledore,all educational decrees will be nullified and you will call off the search on hagrid so he can return to work.
8487,Albus Dumbledore,i will return here later tonight after i have seen to harry.
8488,Albus Dumbledore,it should not take long.
8489,Albus Dumbledore,he taps the golden centaur head.
8490,Albus Dumbledore,portus.
8491,Cornelius Fudge,dumbledore i want some answers!
8492,Albus Dumbledore,the second war has begun minister.
8493,Albus Dumbledore,thank you...
8494,Albus Dumbledore,please sit harry.
8495,Albus Dumbledore,i understand how you feel harry--
8496,Harry Potter,no you don't!
8497,Albus Dumbledore,you forget that sirius was my friend too.
8498,Albus Dumbledore,you are not the only person on this earth capable of feelings harry.
8499,Albus Dumbledore,there is no shame in feeling pain harry.
8500,Albus Dumbledore,it is your greatest strength...
8501,Harry Potter,you don't have a clue!
8502,Harry Potter,you can't possibly know!
8503,Albus Dumbledore,what can't i know?
8504,Albus Dumbledore,this pain is part of being human harry...
8505,Harry Potter,i don't care!
8506,Harry Potter,i don't care!
8507,Albus Dumbledore,you do care.
8508,Albus Dumbledore,you care so much you feel like you will bleed to death because of it.
8509,Harry Potter,let me out.
8510,Albus Dumbledore,no.
8511,Harry Potter,you can't keep me in here!
8512,Albus Dumbledore,i daresay i can.
8513,Albus Dumbledore,and if you actually do attack me with that wand harry i'm afraid to say you will regret it.
8514,Albus Dumbledore,it is my fault sirius died tonight.
8515,Albus Dumbledore,harry i owe you this explanation to show you the failings of an old man.
8516,Harry Potter,i already know all this.
8517,Albus Dumbledore,haven't you wondered why i haven't spoken to you even looked at you for months?
8518,Harry Potter,well yeah i did...
8519,Albus Dumbledore,sirius told me you believed there was a snake inside of you.
8520,Albus Dumbledore,this was voldemort attempting to manipulate you.
8521,Albus Dumbledore,to protect you from this i had you study occlumency.
8522,Harry Potter,but snape stopped giving me lessons.
8523,Albus Dumbledore,yes.
8524,Albus Dumbledore,i thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father but i was wrong.
8525,Albus Dumbledore,some wounds cut too deep to be healed.
8526,Harry Potter,he barely taught me though.
8527,Harry Potter,i always felt more open to it after the lessons.
8528,Harry Potter,like he was trying to open me to voldemort—-
8529,Albus Dumbledore,i would trust severus snape with my life harry.
8530,Albus Dumbledore,you have never recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year.
8531,Harry Potter,sirius didn't trust him.
8532,Harry Potter,didn't believe he'd really turned to our side...
8533,Albus Dumbledore,again some wounds run too deep to be healed harry.
8534,Albus Dumbledore,severus and sirius never liked each other at school.
8535,Albus Dumbledore,this has never changed.
8536,Albus Dumbledore,during your occulumency lessons professor snape discovered that you were dreaming about the door in the department of mysteries.
8537,Harry Potter,i've been dreaming about that all year before voldemort discovered the connection.
8538,Albus Dumbledore,yes.
8539,Albus Dumbledore,voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he returned.
8540,Albus Dumbledore,because of your scar what he was obsessed with you were obsessed with in the form of dreams.
8541,Albus Dumbledore,once he discovered the connection voldemort had little difficulty in manipulating you into thinking he had captured sirius.
8542,Harry Potter,but i checked grimmauld place!
8543,Harry Potter,kreacher said--
8544,Albus Dumbledore,kreacher lied.
8545,Albus Dumbledore,he wanted you to go to the department of mysteries.
8546,Harry Potter,why?
8547,Albus Dumbledore,kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now.
8548,Harry Potter,what?
8549,Harry Potter,wait where was sirius when i tried to contact him?
8550,Albus Dumbledore,ah.
8551,Albus Dumbledore,apparently kreacher had injured buckbeak to distract him in case you tried to contact headquarters.
8552,Albus Dumbledore,sirius was tending to the wounds when you called.
8553,Harry Potter,and hermione said we should be nice to kreacher!
8554,Albus Dumbledore,she was quite right harry.
8555,Albus Dumbledore,kreacher is what wizards have made him.
8556,Albus Dumbledore,he is to be pitied not hated.
8557,Harry Potter,sirius hated him.
8558,Albus Dumbledore,he didn't hate kreacher himself.
8559,Albus Dumbledore,kreacher was a reminder to sirius of the home he had always hated.
8560,Harry Potter,yeah he really hated that place.
8561,Harry Potter,and you kept him locked up in there!
8562,Albus Dumbledore,i was trying to save his life!
8563,Albus Dumbledore,i also knew that voldemort would return one day.
8564,Albus Dumbledore,i played to his weakness.
8565,Albus Dumbledore,there is an ancient magic which voldemort has always underestimated.
8566,Albus Dumbledore,this magic is what your mother gave you when she died.
8567,Albus Dumbledore,that protection would only work however if you were cared for by a blood relative.
8568,Albus Dumbledore,your aunt petunia.
8569,Harry Potter,she never loved me.
8570,Albus Dumbledore,perhaps not.
8571,Albus Dumbledore,but she took you in however grudgingly.
8572,Albus Dumbledore,as long as you can call your aunt's house your home you are protected.
8573,Albus Dumbledore,and now we come to the moment of terrible truth the moment i have dreaded for fifteen years.
8574,Albus Dumbledore,the moment when i must lay another burden atop your already straining shoulders.
8575,Albus Dumbledore,do you remember your first year here?
8576,Albus Dumbledore,when you lay in the hospital wing fresh from your confrontation with voldemort?
8577,Albus Dumbledore,do you remember what you asked me that night?
8578,Harry Potter,i asked you why voldemort tried to kill me.
8579,Albus Dumbledore,you have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you even now.
8580,Albus Dumbledore,but unfortunately i must.
8581,Harry Potter,i don't understand professor.
8582,Harry Potter,professor why am i so important to
8583,Albus Dumbledore,an excellent question harry.
8584,Albus Dumbledore,the answer lies in the prophesy.
8585,Harry Potter,sir it got smashed.
8586,Albus Dumbledore,that was not the only place the prophesy is preserved.
8587,Sybill Trelawney,"""the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches....born to"
8588,Harry Potter,i'm not sure i understand all that sir...
8589,Harry Potter,and...it means me?
8590,Albus Dumbledore,interestingly there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been referring to.
8591,Albus Dumbledore,you and neville longbottom.
8592,Harry Potter,so it's not necessarily me sir?
8593,Harry Potter,what if he chose wrong?
8594,Harry Potter,why didn't he wait?
8595,Harry Potter,why attack when we were babies?
8596,Albus Dumbledore,voldemort had an informant listening to my meeting with professor trelawney.
8597,Albus Dumbledore,fortunately he was discovered before he could hear the entire prophesy.
8598,Albus Dumbledore,voldemort had to act immediately he didn't know the rest of the prophesy.
8599,Albus Dumbledore,all he knew was that he had to destroy the child who would grow to be a threat to his power.
8600,Harry Potter,but i don't have any special powers.
8601,Albus Dumbledore,there is a room in the department of mysteries which is kept locked at all times.
8602,Albus Dumbledore,it contains a force so wonderful and yet terrible that it is greater than death itself.
8603,Albus Dumbledore,it is that power which you have incredible amounts of and of which voldemort has none.
8604,Harry Potter,what is it sir?
8605,Albus Dumbledore,there is only the end of the prophesy which we haven't addressed.
8606,Albus Dumbledore,"it states ""neither can live while the other survives."""
8607,Albus Dumbledore,it is the final burden which i must place on you harry.
8608,Harry Potter,one of us has to kill the other...in the end.
8609,Albus Dumbledore,yes.
8610,Nearly Headless Nick,hello harry.
8611,Harry Potter,hey nick.
8612,Nearly Headless Nick,i--well madam pomfrey asked me to tell you that hermione and ron are out of the hospital wing.
8613,Harry Potter,oh.
8614,Harry Potter,thanks.
8615,Harry Potter,nick i was wondering about something?
8616,Nearly Headless Nick,i've been expecting this...
8617,Harry Potter,expecting what?
8618,Nearly Headless Nick,a lot of people come to me when they've lost loved ones.
8619,Harry Potter,i expect so...
8620,Nearly Headless Nick,he's not coming back harry.
8621,Harry Potter,why?
8622,Nearly Headless Nick,i'm sorry i couldn't be of more
8623,Hermione Granger,harry!
8624,Harry Potter,how are you?
8625,Ron Weasley,good as new mate.
8626,Harry Potter,better.
8627,Hermione Granger,come on let's go in to the feast.
8628,Harry Potter,i've got something to tell you.
8629,Harry Potter,something important.
8630,Harry Potter,but not right now.
8631,Harry Potter,i'm not ready.
8632,Hermione Granger,take your time harry.
8633,Hermione Granger,we'll be here when you are.
8634,Luna Lovegood,hello harry.
8635,Luna Lovegood,it's the last night and i need to pack.
8636,Luna Lovegood,oh people take my things and hide them.
8637,Luna Lovegood,i don't think they like me much.
8638,Luna Lovegood,"some of them call me ""loony"" lovegood."
8639,Harry Potter,do you need any help looking?
8640,Luna Lovegood,oh no.
8641,Luna Lovegood,it all turns up in the end.
8642,Luna Lovegood,sirius black.
8643,Luna Lovegood,hermione said he was your godfather.
8644,Harry Potter,yeah.
8645,Luna Lovegood,my mother.
8646,Luna Lovegood,i was nine.
8647,Harry Potter,i'm sorry.
8648,Luna Lovegood,it's okay.
8649,Luna Lovegood,it's not like i'll never see her again.
8650,Harry Potter,isn't it?
8651,Luna Lovegood,don't tell me you didn't hear them.
8652,Luna Lovegood,the voices beyond the veil?
8653,Luna Lovegood,they were just out of sight that's all.
8654,Luna Lovegood,of course.
8655,Luna Lovegood,anyway my mum always said the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end.
8656,Luna Lovegood,if not always in the way we expect.
8657,Luna Lovegood,think i'll just go have some pudding.
8658,Harry Potter,i've been thinking about something dumbledore said to me.
8659,Hermione Granger,what's that ?
8660,Harry Potter,that even though we've got a fight ahead of us we've got one thing that voldemort doesn't have.
8661,Ron Weasley,yeah ?
8662,Harry Potter,something worth fighting for
8663,Bellatrix Lestrange,narcissa!
8664,Bellatrix Lestrange,cissy!
8665,Bellatrix Lestrange,you mustn't do this.
8666,Bellatrix Lestrange,he can't be trusted.
8667,Narcissa Malfoy,the dark lord trusts him.
8668,Bellatrix Lestrange,the dark lord is mistaken.
8669,Bellatrix Lestrange,or so i believe.
8670,Narcissa Malfoy,well who can one trust these days?
8671,Bellatrix Lestrange,he lives in this muggle dunghill?
8672,Severus Snape,run along wormtail.
8673,Narcissa Malfoy,i've nowhere else to turn severus.
8674,Bellatrix Lestrange,you must be joking.
8675,Narcissa Malfoy,i know i ought not to be here.
8676,Narcissa Malfoy,the dark lord himself has forbidden me to speak of this --
8677,Severus Snape,if the dark lord has forbidden it you ought not to speak.
8678,Severus Snape,put it down bella.
8679,Severus Snape,we mustn't touch what isn't ours.
8680,Severus Snape,as it so happens i'm aware of your situation narcissa.
8681,Bellatrix Lestrange,you?
8682,Bellatrix Lestrange,the dark lord told you?
8683,Severus Snape,your sister doubts me narcissa.
8684,Severus Snape,understandable.
8685,Severus Snape,over the years i have played my part well.
8686,Severus Snape,so well i've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time.
8687,Severus Snape,dumbledore is a great wizard.
8688,Severus Snape,only a fool would question it.
8689,Narcissa Malfoy,i... i don't doubt you severus.
8690,Bellatrix Lestrange,you should feel honored cissy.
8691,Bellatrix Lestrange,as should draco --
8692,Narcissa Malfoy,he's just a boy!
8693,Severus Snape,i can't change the dark lord's mind.
8694,Severus Snape,but it might be possible for me to help draco.
8695,Severus Snape,to provide some... protection.
8696,Narcissa Malfoy,do you mean it severus?
8697,Severus Snape,i can try.
8698,Narcissa Malfoy,oh severus please if you would... i would be forever in your debt.
8699,Bellatrix Lestrange,swear to it.
8700,Bellatrix Lestrange,make the unbreakable vow.
8701,Bellatrix Lestrange,you see.
8702,Bellatrix Lestrange,it's just empty words.
8703,Bellatrix Lestrange,oh he'll try.
8704,Bellatrix Lestrange,he'll give it his best effort.
8705,Bellatrix Lestrange,but when it matters most he'll slither back into his hole.
8706,Bellatrix Lestrange,bloody coward...
8707,Severus Snape,take out your wand.
8708,Bellatrix Lestrange,will you severus snape watch over draco malfoy as he attempts to fulfill the dark lord's wishes.
8709,Severus Snape,i will.
8710,Bellatrix Lestrange,and will you to the best of your ability protect him from harm?
8711,Severus Snape,i will.
8712,Bellatrix Lestrange,and should it prove necessary if it seems draco will fail... will you yourself carry out the deed that the dark lord has ordered draco to perform?
8713,Severus Snape,i will.
8714,Waitress,harry potter.
8715,Waitress,who's harry potter?
8716,Harry Potter,oh.
8717,Harry Potter,um.
8718,Harry Potter,no one.
8719,Harry Potter,bit of a tosser.
8720,Waitress,funny that paper of yours.
8721,Waitress,couple nights ago i could swear i saw one of the pictures move.
8722,Harry Potter,really.
8723,Waitress,thought i'd gone round the twist.
8724,Harry Potter,hey.
8725,Harry Potter,i was wondering...
8726,Waitress,eleven.
8727,Waitress,that's when i get off.
8728,Albus Dumbledore,i once knew a muggle girl from liverpool with hair like spun silk.
8729,Albus Dumbledore,no light could resist it...
8730,Harry Potter,i like riding round on the trains.
8731,Harry Potter,it takes my mind off... things.
8732,Albus Dumbledore,rather unpleasant to behold isn't it?
8733,Albus Dumbledore,the tale is thrilling if i do say so myself but i'm afraid now is not the time to tell it.
8734,Albus Dumbledore,take my arm.
8735,Harry Potter,i just apparated didn't i?
8736,Albus Dumbledore,indeed.
8737,Albus Dumbledore,and quite successfully i might add.
8738,Albus Dumbledore,most people vomit their first time.
8739,Harry Potter,can't imagine why...
8740,Albus Dumbledore,welcome to the charming village of budleigh babberton harry.
8741,Albus Dumbledore,i assume right about now you're wondering why i've brought you here am i right?
8742,Harry Potter,after all these years i just sort of roll with it sir.
8743,Albus Dumbledore,wand out harry.
8744,Albus Dumbledore,lumos...
8745,Albus Dumbledore,horace!
8746,Horace Slughorn,merlin's beard!
8747,Horace Slughorn,there's no need to disfigure me albus!
8748,Albus Dumbledore,i must say you make a very convincing armchair horace.
8749,Horace Slughorn,it's all in the upholstery.
8750,Horace Slughorn,i come by the stuffing naturally.
8751,Horace Slughorn,what gave me away?
8752,Albus Dumbledore,dragon's blood.
8753,Horace Slughorn,yes well i couldn't very well use wizard's blood could i?

8760,Albus Dumbledore,so why all the theatrics horace?
8761,Albus Dumbledore,you weren't perhaps expecting someone else were you?
8762,Horace Slughorn,s-someone else?
8763,Horace Slughorn,i'm sure i don't know what you mean.
8764,Horace Slughorn,oh all right!
8765,Horace Slughorn,the death eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year.
8766,Horace Slughorn,do you know what that's like?
8767,Horace Slughorn,one can only say no to these people so many times before they...
8768,Albus Dumbledore,take matters into their own hands?
8769,Horace Slughorn,i never stay anywhere more than a week.
8770,Horace Slughorn,the muggles who own this place are in the canary islands.
8771,Albus Dumbledore,well i think it should be put back in order for them don't you?
8772,Albus Dumbledore,mind?

8775,Horace Slughorn,don't think i don't know why you're here albus!
8776,Horace Slughorn,the answer is still no!

8783,Horace Slughorn,lovely lily.

8850,Molly Weasley,harry who?
8851,Ginny Weasley,harry dimpleton.

8854,Ginny Weasley,well his trunk's in the kitchen.
8855,Ginny Weasley,and his owl.
8856,Molly Weasley,i seriously doubt that.
8857,Ron Weasley,harry?
8858,Ron Weasley,did someone say harry?
8859,Ginny Weasley,me nosy.
8860,Ginny Weasley,is he up there with you?
8861,Ron Weasley,'course not.
8862,Ron Weasley,think i'd know if my best friend was in my room wouldn't i?
8863,Hermione Granger,was that an owl i heard?
8864,Ginny Weasley,harry's.
8865,Ginny Weasley,haven't seen him have you?
8866,Ginny Weasley,apparently he's wandering about the house.
8867,Hermione Granger,really?
8868,Harry Potter,really.
8869,Ron Weasley,harry!
8870,Hermione Granger,harry!
8871,Molly Weasley,but why didn't you tell us you were coming?
8872,Harry Potter,didn't know.
8873,Harry Potter,dumbledore.
8874,Molly Weasley,that man.
8875,Molly Weasley,but then what would we do without him?
8876,Molly Weasley,ron!
8877,Ron Weasley,you've a bit of...
8878,Harry Potter,when'd you get here?
8879,Hermione Granger,a few days ago.
8880,Hermione Granger,though... for a bit i wasn't sure i was coming.
8881,Ron Weasley,mum sort of lost it last week.
8882,Ron Weasley,said ginny and i had no business going back to hogwarts.
8883,Ron Weasley,that it's too dangerous.
8884,Harry Potter,oh come on...
8885,Hermione Granger,she's not alone.
8886,Hermione Granger,even my parents -- and they're muggles -- know something bad is happening.
8887,Ron Weasley,anyway dad stepped in told her she was being barmy.
8888,Ron Weasley,took a day or two but she came round.
8889,Harry Potter,but we're talking about hogwarts.
8890,Harry Potter,dumbledore.
8891,Harry Potter,what could be safer?
8892,Hermione Granger,there's been a lot of chatter lately.
8893,Hermione Granger,that he's gotten... old.
8894,Harry Potter,rubbish.
8895,Harry Potter,he's only -- what?
8896,Ron Weasley,a hundred and fifty.

8935,Ron Weasley,let's go.
8936,Lavender Brown,hi ron.
8937,Ron Weasley,hi.
8938,Hermione Granger,how is it fred and george are doing it?
8939,Hermione Granger,half the alley's closed down.
8940,Ron Weasley,fred reckons people need a laugh these days.
8941,Harry Potter,reckon he's right...
8942,Hermione Granger,oh no.

8946,Hermione Granger,old...
8947,Harry Potter,good.
8948,Harry Potter,bad.
8949,Harry Potter,speaking of which...
8950,Ron Weasley,is it just me?
8951,Ron Weasley,or do draco and mummy look like two people who don't want to be followed?
8952,Ron Weasley,what're they playing at?
8953,Harry Potter,dunno.
8954,Harry Potter,let's get closer.
8955,Ron Weasley,hey.
8956,Ron Weasley,where's hermione?
8957,Ron Weasley,harry where is she?
8958,Harry Potter,i don't know.
8959,Harry Potter,i'm turned around.
8960,Ron Weasley,bloody hell.
8961,Hermione Granger,sorry.
8962,Harry Potter,what just happened?
8963,Hermione Granger,i don't know.
8964,Luna Lovegood,quibbler...?
8965,Luna Lovegood,quibbler...?
8966,Luna Lovegood,there's an article on wrackspurts this month.
8967,Luna Lovegood,quibbler...?
8968,Luna Lovegood,he's lovely.
8969,Luna Lovegood,they've been known to sing on boxing day you know.
8970,Luna Lovegood,quibbler?
8971,Ginny Weasley,please.
8972,Ginny Weasley,what's a wrackspurt?
8973,Luna Lovegood,they're invisible creatures that float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy.
8974,Luna Lovegood,quibbler?
8975,Luna Lovegood,quibbler?
8976,Harry Potter,don't you see it was a ceremony.
8977,Harry Potter,an initiation.
8978,Hermione Granger,stop harry i know where you're going with this --
8979,Harry Potter,it's happened.
8980,Harry Potter,he's one of them.
8981,Ron Weasley,one of what?
8982,Hermione Granger,harry is under the impression that draco malfoy is now a death eater.
8983,Ron Weasley,you're barking.
8984,Ron Weasley,what would you- know-who want with a sod like malfoy?
8985,Harry Potter,so what's he doing in borgin and burke's?
8986,Harry Potter,browsing for furniture?
8987,Ron Weasley,it's a creepy shop.
8988,Ron Weasley,he's a creepy bloke.
8989,Harry Potter,look.
8990,Harry Potter,his father's a death eater.
8991,Harry Potter,it only makes sense.
8992,Harry Potter,besides hermione saw it.
8993,Harry Potter,with her own eyes.
8994,Hermione Granger,i told you.
8995,Hermione Granger,i don't know what i saw.
8996,Harry Potter,i need some air.
8997,Draco Malfoy,what just happened?
8998,Draco Malfoy,blaise?
8999,Blaise Zabini,don't know.
9000,Pansy Parkinson,relax boys.
9001,Pansy Parkinson,the lights went out is all.
9002,Pansy Parkinson,come draco.
9003,Pansy Parkinson,we'll be at hogwarts before you know it.
9004,Draco Malfoy,hogwarts.
9005,Draco Malfoy,what a pathetic excuse for a school.
9006,Draco Malfoy,i think i'd pitch myself off the astronomy tower if i thought i had to continue on for another two years.
9007,Pansy Parkinson,what's that supposed to mean?
9008,Draco Malfoy,let's just say i don't think you'll be seeing me wasting my time in charms class next year.
9009,Draco Malfoy,amused blaise?
9010,Draco Malfoy,we'll see just who's laughing in the end.
9011,Hermione Granger,where's harry?
9012,Ron Weasley,probably on the platform.
9013,Ron Weasley,c'mon.
9014,Draco Malfoy,you two go on.
9015,Draco Malfoy,i want to check something.
9016,Draco Malfoy,didn't mummy ever tell you it's bad manners to eavesdrop potter?
9017,Draco Malfoy,petrificus totalus!
9018,Draco Malfoy,oh right she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin.
9019,Draco Malfoy,enjoy the ride back to london.
9020,Luna Lovegood,hello harry.
9021,Harry Potter,luna.
9022,Harry Potter,how'd you...?
9023,Luna Lovegood,wrackspurts.
9024,Luna Lovegood,your head's full of them.
9025,Harry Potter,sorry i made you miss the carriages luna.
9026,Luna Lovegood,it's alright.
9027,Luna Lovegood,i enjoyed our walk.
9028,Luna Lovegood,it was like being with a friend.
9029,Harry Potter,i am your friend luna.
9030,Luna Lovegood,that's nice.
9031,Filius Flitwick,about time!
9032,Filius Flitwick,i've been looking all over for you two.
9033,Filius Flitwick,names.
9034,Harry Potter,professor flitwick you've known me for five years.
9035,Filius Flitwick,no exceptions potter.
9036,Luna Lovegood,who are those people?
9037,Filius Flitwick,aurors.
9038,Filius Flitwick,for security.
9039,Draco Malfoy,it's a not a cane you cretin.
9040,Draco Malfoy,it's a walking stick.
9041,Argus Filch,and what exactly would you be wanting with a walking stick?
9042,Severus Snape,it was his father's.
9043,Draco Malfoy,is my father's.
9044,Draco Malfoy,he's not dead.
9045,Severus Snape,it's alright mr. filch.
9046,Severus Snape,i can vouch for mr. malfoy.
9047,Draco Malfoy,nice face potter.
9048,Luna Lovegood,would you like me to fix it?
9049,Luna Lovegood,personally i think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way.
9050,Luna Lovegood,but it's up to you.
9051,Harry Potter,have you ever fixed one?
9052,Harry Potter,a nose.
9053,Luna Lovegood,no.
9054,Luna Lovegood,but i've done several toes and how different are they really?
9055,Harry Potter,what the hell.
9056,Harry Potter,give it a go.
9057,Luna Lovegood,episkey.
9058,Harry Potter,well?
9059,Harry Potter,how do i look?
9060,Luna Lovegood,exceptionally ordinary.
9061,Harry Potter,brilliant.
9062,Ron Weasley,don' you worry.
9063,Ron Weasley,he'll be 'long soon 'nuff --
9064,Hermione Granger,will.
9065,Hermione Granger,you.
9066,Hermione Granger,stop.
9067,Hermione Granger,eating!
9068,Hermione Granger,your best friend is missing!
9069,Ron Weasley,oi!
9070,Ron Weasley,turn around you lunatic.
9071,Ginny Weasley,he's covered in blood again.
9072,Ginny Weasley,why is it he's always covered in blood?
9073,Ron Weasley,looks like his own this time.
9074,Hermione Granger,where've you been harry?
9075,Hermione Granger,and what happened to your face?
9076,Harry Potter,later.
9077,Harry Potter,what've i missed?
9078,Ron Weasley,sorting hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times -- easy for it to say -- it's a hat isn't it?
9079,Ron Weasley,first years seemed to enjoy it though.
9080,Ron Weasley,wankers.
9081,Ron Weasley,filch give you the wand outside?
9082,Harry Potter,thanks...
9083,Hermione Granger,what's happened to his hand?
9084,Albus Dumbledore,the very best of evenings to you!
9085,Albus Dumbledore,first off please join me in welcoming the newest member of our staff horace slughorn.
9086,Albus Dumbledore,professor slughorn i'm happy to say has agreed to resume his old post of potions master.
9087,Albus Dumbledore,meanwhile the post of defense against the dark arts will be assumed by professor snape.
9088,Albus Dumbledore,now as you know each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival tonight.
9089,Albus Dumbledore,you have a right to know why.
9090,Albus Dumbledore,once there was a young man who like you sat in this very hall.
9091,Albus Dumbledore,walked this castle's corridors.
9092,Albus Dumbledore,slept beneath its roof.
9093,Albus Dumbledore,he seemed to all the world a student like any other.
9094,Albus Dumbledore,his name?
9095,Albus Dumbledore,tom riddle.
9096,Albus Dumbledore,the hall goes utterly silent.
9097,Albus Dumbledore,today of course the world knows him by another name.
9098,Albus Dumbledore,which is why as i stand looking out upon you all tonight i am reminded of a sobering fact.
9099,Albus Dumbledore,each day every hour this very minute perhaps dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle.
9100,Albus Dumbledore,but in the end their greatest weapon remains... you.
9101,Albus Dumbledore,just something to keep in mind.
9102,Albus Dumbledore,now off to bed.
9103,Albus Dumbledore,pip pip!
9104,Ron Weasley,that was cheerful.
9105,Minerva McGonagall,history of magic is up ladies not down.
9106,Minerva McGonagall,mr. davies -- that's the girl's toilet...
9107,Minerva McGonagall,potter!
9108,Harry Potter,this can't be good.
9109,Minerva McGonagall,enjoying ourself are we?
9110,Harry Potter,well you see i've got an open period this morning professor --
9111,Minerva McGonagall,so i noticed.
9112,Minerva McGonagall,i would think you'd want to fill it with potions.
9113,Minerva McGonagall,or is it no longer your ambition to become an auror?
9114,Harry Potter,it is.
9115,Harry Potter,or was.
9116,Harry Potter,but i was told i had to get an outstanding in my
9117,Minerva McGonagall,and so you did when professor snape was teaching potions.
9118,Minerva McGonagall,however professor slughorn is perfectly happy to accept n.e.w.t.
9119,Minerva McGonagall,students with 'exceeds expectations.'
9120,Harry Potter,really?
9121,Harry Potter,well... brilliant.
9122,Harry Potter,i'll head there straight away.
9123,Minerva McGonagall,good.
9124,Minerva McGonagall,and take weasley with you.
9125,Minerva McGonagall,he looks far too happy over there.
9126,Ron Weasley,but i don't want to take potions!
9127,Horace Slughorn,harry m'boy!
9128,Horace Slughorn,i was beginning to worry!
9129,Horace Slughorn,and i see we've brought someone with us...
9130,Ron Weasley,ron weasley sir.
9131,Ron Weasley,but i'm dead awful at potions a menace actually so i probably should just be going --
9132,Horace Slughorn,nonsense we'll sort you out.
9133,Horace Slughorn,any friend of harry's is a friend of mine.
9134,Horace Slughorn,right then books out --
9135,Harry Potter,um sorry sir but i haven't got my book yet -- nor's ron.
9136,Harry Potter,you see --
9137,Horace Slughorn,not to worry.
9138,Horace Slughorn,you can get what you need from the cupboard.
9139,Horace Slughorn,now as i was saying i've prepared a few concoctions this morning.
9140,Horace Slughorn,any ideas what these might be?
9141,Horace Slughorn,yes miss...?
9142,Hermione Granger,granger sir.
9143,Hermione Granger,that one there is veritaserum.
9144,Hermione Granger,and that would be polyjuice potion.
9145,Hermione Granger,and that is amortentia!
9146,Hermione Granger,the most powerful love potion in the world.
9147,Hermione Granger,it's rumored to smell differently to each person according to what attracts them.
9148,Hermione Granger,for example i smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste --
9149,Horace Slughorn,one of my best friends is muggle- born.
9150,Horace Slughorn,she's the best in our year...
9151,Horace Slughorn,now amortentia doesn't create actual love of course.
9152,Horace Slughorn,that's impossible.
9153,Horace Slughorn,but it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession.
9154,Horace Slughorn,for that reason it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room.
9155,Katie Bell,sir you haven't told us what's in that one.
9156,Horace Slughorn,ah yes...
9157,Horace Slughorn,what you see before you ladies and gentlemen is a curious little potion known as felix felicis.
9158,Horace Slughorn,but it is more commonly referred to as --
9159,Hermione Granger,liquid luck.
9160,Horace Slughorn,yes miss granger.
9161,Horace Slughorn,desperately tricky to make.
9162,Horace Slughorn,disastrous should you get it wrong.
9163,Horace Slughorn,but brewed correctly as this has been it has remarkable powers.
9164,Horace Slughorn,one sip and you will find that all your endeavors succeed... at least until the effects wear off.
9165,Katie Bell,but then why don't people drink it all the time?
9166,Horace Slughorn,because taken in excess it causes giddiness recklessness and dangerous overconfidence.
9167,Blaise Zabini,have you ever taken it sir?
9168,Horace Slughorn,twice.
9169,Horace Slughorn,once when i was twenty- four.
9170,Horace Slughorn,once when i was fifty- seven.
9171,Horace Slughorn,two tablespoons taken at breakfast.
9172,Horace Slughorn,two perfect days...
9173,Horace Slughorn,so.
9174,Horace Slughorn,this is what i offer each of you today.
9175,Horace Slughorn,one tiny vial of liquid luck... to the student who in the hour that remains manages to brew an acceptable draught of living death the recipe for which can be found on page ten of your textbook.
9176,Horace Slughorn,you should know that in all the years of my previous tenure at hogwarts not once did a student brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize.
9177,Horace Slughorn,in any event -- good luck.
9178,Hermione Granger,how did you do that?
9179,Harry Potter,crush it.
9180,Harry Potter,don't cut it.
9181,Hermione Granger,no.
9182,Hermione Granger,the instructions specifically say to cut.
9183,Harry Potter,no.
9184,Harry Potter,really --
9185,Hermione Granger,sh!
9186,Horace Slughorn,merlin's beard!
9187,Horace Slughorn,but it's perfect.
9188,Horace Slughorn,so perfect i daresay one sip would kill us all!
9189,Horace Slughorn,your mother was a dab hand at potions but this... my my what can't you do m'boy?
9190,Horace Slughorn,perhaps you will save us all in the end...
9191,Horace Slughorn,here you are then as promised.
9192,Horace Slughorn,one bottle of felix felicis.
9193,Horace Slughorn,use it well.
9194,Albus Dumbledore,good evening harry.
9195,Albus Dumbledore,you got my message i see.
9196,Albus Dumbledore,come come.
9197,Albus Dumbledore,sit.
9198,Albus Dumbledore,so.
9199,Albus Dumbledore,how are you?
9200,Harry Potter,fine sir.
9201,Albus Dumbledore,enjoying your classes?
9202,Albus Dumbledore,professor slughorn for one is most impressed with you.
9203,Harry Potter,i think he overestimates my abilities sir.
9204,Albus Dumbledore,do you?
9205,Harry Potter,definitely.
9206,Albus Dumbledore,and what of your activities outside the classroom?
9207,Albus Dumbledore,do they bring you satisfaction?
9208,Harry Potter,sir?
9209,Albus Dumbledore,i notice you spend a great deal of time with miss granger.
9210,Albus Dumbledore,one can't help but wonder if --
9211,Harry Potter,no!
9212,Harry Potter,i mean... she's brilliant.
9213,Harry Potter,and we're friends.
9214,Harry Potter,but... no.
9215,Albus Dumbledore,forgive me harry i...
9216,Albus Dumbledore,... i was merely curious.
9217,Albus Dumbledore,in any event i'm sure you're wondering why i've summoned you here tonight.
9218,Albus Dumbledore,the answer lies here.
9219,Albus Dumbledore,what you see before you are memories.
9220,Albus Dumbledore,in this case pertaining to one individual:  voldemort.
9221,Albus Dumbledore,or as he was known then... tom riddle.
9222,Albus Dumbledore,this vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day i first met him.
9223,Albus Dumbledore,i'd like you to see it.
9224,Albus Dumbledore,if you would...
9225,Mrs. Cole,i must confess to a bit of confusion upon receiving your letter mr. dumbledore.
9226,Mrs. Cole,in all the years tom's been here he's never once had a family visitor.
9227,Mrs. Cole,frankly i was stunned to find that someone knew of his existence.
9228,Albus Dumbledore,i am not family.
9229,Albus Dumbledore,but his name has been known to me since birth.
9230,Mrs. Cole,i see...
9231,Mrs. Cole,i think i should tell you.
9232,Mrs. Cole,he's a funny boy -- tom.
9233,Mrs. Cole,odd.
9234,Mrs. Cole,there have been incidents with the other children.
9235,Mrs. Cole,nasty things.
9236,Albus Dumbledore,perhaps you could give me an example.
9237,Mrs. Cole,you've got a visitor tom.
9238,Albus Dumbledore,how do you do tom.
9239,Mrs. Cole,well i'll leave you two to yourselves.
9240,Voldemort,don't.
9241,Albus Dumbledore,as you wish.
9242,Voldemort,you're the doctor aren't you?
9243,Albus Dumbledore,no.
9244,Albus Dumbledore,i am a professor.
9245,Voldemort,i don't believe you.
9246,Voldemort,i hear mrs. cole talking her and the rest of the staff.
9247,Voldemort,they want me looked at.
9248,Voldemort,they think i'm different.
9249,Albus Dumbledore,perhaps they're right.
9250,Voldemort,i'm not mad.
9251,Albus Dumbledore,hogwarts is not a place for mad people.
9252,Albus Dumbledore,it's a school.
9253,Albus Dumbledore,a school of... magic.

9355,Ron Weasley,not bloody likely.
9356,Ron Weasley,he's top of the class.
9357,Ron Weasley,even better than you hermione.
9358,Ron Weasley,slughorn thinks he's a genius.
9359,Ron Weasley,what?

9361,Hermione Granger,let's take a look shall we?
9362,Harry Potter,no.
9363,Hermione Granger,why not?
9364,Harry Potter,it's... old.

9366,Hermione Granger,the binding is fragile?
9367,Ginny Weasley,who's the half-blood prince?
9368,Hermione Granger,the who?
9369,Ron Weasley,the who?
9370,Ginny Weasley,that's what it says.
9371,Ginny Weasley,right here.
9372,Ginny Weasley,'this book is the property of the half-blood prince.'
9373,Hermione Granger,for weeks you carry around this book practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who the half-blood prince is?
9374,Harry Potter,i didn't say i wasn't curious.
9375,Harry Potter,and by the way i don't sleep with it.
9376,Ron Weasley,yeah.
9377,Ron Weasley,right.
9378,Ron Weasley,well it's true.

9550,Horace Slughorn,what about your uncle belby?
9551,Horace Slughorn,working on anything new?
9552,Horace Slughorn,for those of you who don't know marcus' uncle invented the wolfsbane potion.
9553,Marcus Belby,dunno.
9554,Marcus Belby,he and me dad don't get on.

9556,Marcus Belby,says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the --
9557,Horace Slughorn,and you miss granger?
9558,Horace Slughorn,what is it your family does in the muggle world?

9561,Horace Slughorn,fascinating.
9562,Horace Slughorn,and is that considered a dangerous profession?
9563,Hermione Granger,no.
9564,Hermione Granger,though a boy named robbie fenwick did bite my father once.
9565,Hermione Granger,needed ten stitches.

9568,Ginny Weasley,sorry i'm not ordinarily late --

9573,Hermione Granger,they've been fighting again.
9574,Hermione Granger,her and dean.
9575,Harry Potter,what?
9576,Hermione Granger,nothing.

9581,Harry Potter,sorry sir i was just admiring your hourglass.
9582,Horace Slughorn,ah yes.
9583,Horace Slughorn,a most intriguing object.
9584,Horace Slughorn,the sands run in accordance to the quality of the conversation.
9585,Horace Slughorn,when it is stimulating the sands run slow.
9586,Horace Slughorn,when it is not...
9587,Harry Potter,i think i'll be going.
9588,Horace Slughorn,nonsense.
9589,Horace Slughorn,you have nothing to fear m'boy.
9590,Horace Slughorn,as for some of your classmates well let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf.
9591,Harry Potter,the shelf sir?
9592,Horace Slughorn,anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.
9593,Horace Slughorn,then again... you are already someone aren't you harry?
9594,Harry Potter,i don't really know how to answer that sir.
9595,Horace Slughorn,your mother was modest too.
9596,Horace Slughorn,your father not so much.
9597,Horace Slughorn,as you can see he did not make the shelf.
9598,Harry Potter,did voldemort ever make the shelf sir?
9599,Harry Potter,you knew him didn't you sir?
9600,Harry Potter,tom riddle.
9601,Harry Potter,you were his teacher.

9604,Harry Potter,i'm sorry sir.
9605,Harry Potter,forgive me.
9606,Harry Potter,he killed my parents you see...
9607,Horace Slughorn,of course.
9608,Horace Slughorn,it's only natural that you should want to know more.
9609,Horace Slughorn,i'm afraid i must disappoint you harry.
9610,Horace Slughorn,when i first met young mr. riddle he was simply a quiet albeit brilliant boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.
9611,Horace Slughorn,not unlike the others i've known.
9612,Horace Slughorn,in fact not unlike... you.
9613,Horace Slughorn,if the monster existed it was buried deep within.
9614,Neville Longbottom,good luck eh ron?

9627,Hermione Granger,actually i was going to ask you.
9628,Ron Weasley,really?
9629,Hermione Granger,really.
9630,Hermione Granger,but seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea --

9642,Luna Lovegood,is it a tonic?
9643,Hermione Granger,don't drink that ron!
9644,Hermione Granger,you could be expelled for that.
9645,Harry Potter,dunno what you're talking about.
9646,Ron Weasley,c'mon harry.
9647,Ron Weasley,we've got a game to win.
9648,Ginny Weasley,what's gotten into him?

9657,Hermione Granger,you shouldn't have done it harry.
9658,Harry Potter,yeah.
9659,Harry Potter,i suppose i could've just used i dunno... a confundus charm?
9660,Hermione Granger,that was different.
9661,Hermione Granger,it was tryouts.
9662,Hermione Granger,this was an actual match --
9663,Hermione Granger,you didn't put it in?
9664,Hermione Granger,ron only thought you did?

9686,Hermione Granger,i really couldn't care less.
9687,Hermione Granger,was i under the impression that he and i would be attending slughorn's christmas party together?
9688,Hermione Granger,yes.
9689,Hermione Granger,of course now given the circumstances i've had to make other arrangements.
9690,Harry Potter,have you?
9691,Hermione Granger,yes.
9692,Hermione Granger,why?
9693,Harry Potter,i just thought you know since neither one of us can take who we'd really like... maybe we'd go together.
9694,Harry Potter,as friends.
9695,Hermione Granger,why didn't i think of that?
9696,Harry Potter,so who are you taking?
9697,Hermione Granger,um... it's a surprise.
9698,Hermione Granger,besides it's you we need to worry about.
9699,Hermione Granger,and you can't pick just anyone.
9700,Hermione Granger,see that girl over there.
9701,Hermione Granger,that's romilda vane.
9702,Hermione Granger,rumor has it she's trying to slip you a love potion.
9703,Harry Potter,really...?
9704,Hermione Granger,hey!
9705,Hermione Granger,she's only interested in you because she thinks you're the chosen one.
9706,Hermione Granger,you know that right?
9707,Harry Potter,but i am the chosen one.
9708,Harry Potter,okay.
9709,Harry Potter,kidding.
9710,Harry Potter,i'll just ask someone i like.
9711,Harry Potter,someone cool.
9712,Luna Lovegood,i've never been to this part of the castle.
9713,Luna Lovegood,at least not while awake.
9714,Luna Lovegood,i sleepwalk you see.
9715,Luna Lovegood,it's why i wear shoes to bed.
9716,Horace Slughorn,someone has taken a bite out of it.
9717,Horace Slughorn,thank you adrian!
9718,Horace Slughorn,one of mine.
9719,Horace Slughorn,class of '78.
9720,Horace Slughorn,i had hoped for more out of him but at least the pictures are in focus.
9721,Horace Slughorn,oh my!
9722,Horace Slughorn,excuse me harry.
9723,Horace Slughorn,i must greet the new minister of magical transportation.
9724,Horace Slughorn,class of '67.
9725,Horace Slughorn,mingle m'boy!
9726,Horace Slughorn,mingle!
9727,Horace Slughorn,we're all friends here.
9728,Horace Slughorn,and we run the world.
9729,Neville Longbottom,drink?
9730,Harry Potter,neville...?
9731,Neville Longbottom,i didn't make the cut for the slug club.
9732,Neville Longbottom,it's okay.
9733,Neville Longbottom,he's got belby handing out towels in the loo.
9734,Eldred Worple,lovegood did you say?
9735,Eldred Worple,i once encountered a seriously unbalanced man by that name at a book signing.
9736,Eldred Worple,claimed to run a magazine...
9737,Harry Potter,what're you doing?
9738,Harry Potter,and what's happened to you?
9739,Hermione Granger,hm?
9740,Hermione Granger,oh i've just escaped -- i mean left cormac.
9741,Hermione Granger,under the mistletoe.
9742,Harry Potter,cormac!
9743,Harry Potter,that's who you invited!
9744,Hermione Granger,i thought it would annoy ron most.
9745,Hermione Granger,but he's a menace.
9746,Hermione Granger,he's got more tentacles than a snarfalump plant.
9747,Waiter,dragon tartar?
9748,Hermione Granger,no thank you.
9749,Waiter,just as well.
9750,Waiter,they give one horribly bad breath.
9751,Hermione Granger,on second thought -- maybe it'll keep cormac at bay.
9752,Hermione Granger,oh no here he comes!
9753,Harry Potter,i think she went to powder her nose.
9754,Cormac McLaggen,slippery little minx your friend.
9755,Cormac McLaggen,likes to work her mouth too doesn't she?
9756,Cormac McLaggen,yak yak yak.
9757,Cormac McLaggen,what is this i'm eating by the way?
9758,Harry Potter,dragon balls.
9759,Severus Snape,what's going on back here?
9760,Severus Snape,you've just bought yourself a month's detention mclaggen.
9761,Severus Snape,not so quick potter.
9762,Harry Potter,i think i should rejoin the party sir.
9763,Harry Potter,my date...
9764,Severus Snape,... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.
9765,Severus Snape,besides i only wish to convey a message.
9766,Harry Potter,a message...?
9767,Severus Snape,from professor dumbledore.
9768,Severus Snape,he asked that i give you his best and that he hopes you enjoy your holiday.
9769,Severus Snape,you see he's traveling and won't return until term resumes.
9770,Harry Potter,traveling?
9771,Harry Potter,where?
9772,Draco Malfoy,take your hands off me  you filthy squib!
9773,Argus Filch,professor slughorn sir!
9774,Argus Filch,i've just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor.
9775,Argus Filch,he claims to have been invited to your party.
9776,Draco Malfoy,okay okay i was gate-crashing.
9777,Draco Malfoy,happy?
9778,Severus Snape,i'll escort him out.
9779,Draco Malfoy,certainly... professor.
9780,Draco Malfoy,maybe i did hex that bell girl.
9781,Draco Malfoy,maybe i didn't.
9782,Draco Malfoy,what's it to you?
9783,Severus Snape,i swore to protect you.
9784,Severus Snape,i made the unbreakable vow --
9785,Draco Malfoy,i don't need protection.
9786,Draco Malfoy,i was chosen for this!
9787,Draco Malfoy,out of all others.
9788,Draco Malfoy,me!
9789,Draco Malfoy,and i won't fail him.
9790,Severus Snape,you're afraid draco.
9791,Severus Snape,you attempt to conceal it but it's obvious.
9792,Severus Snape,let me assist you --
9793,Draco Malfoy,no!
9794,Draco Malfoy,i was chosen.
9795,Draco Malfoy,this is my moment!
9796,Ron Weasley,unbreakable vow.
9797,Ron Weasley,you're sure that's what snape said.
9798,Harry Potter,positive.
9799,Harry Potter,why?
9800,Ron Weasley,it's just well you can't break an unbreakable vow.
9801,Harry Potter,i'd worked that much out for myself funnily enough.
9802,Ron Weasley,no you don't understand -- oh bloody hell...
9803,Harry Potter,lovely.
9804,Ron Weasley,all she wants to do is snog me.
9805,Ron Weasley,my lips are getting chapped.
9806,Ron Weasley,look.
9807,Harry Potter,i'll take your word for it.
9808,Harry Potter,so what happens?
9809,Harry Potter,if you break an unbreakable vow?
9810,Ron Weasley,you die.
9811,Molly Weasley,eat up eat up everyone!
9812,Molly Weasley,there's more to come!
9813,Harry Potter,draco's plotting something i know it something to do with voldemort.
9814,Harry Potter,he's been given a task or a mission -- and snape was offering to help.
9815,Remus Lupin,voldemort has chosen draco malfoy for a mission?
9816,Harry Potter,i know it sounds mad --
9817,Remus Lupin,has it occurred to you harry that snape was simply pretending to offer draco help so that he could find out what he's up to?
9818,Harry Potter,that's not what it sounded like.
9819,Nymphadora Tonks,perhaps harry's right remus.
9820,Nymphadora Tonks,to make an unbreakable vow after all --
9821,Remus Lupin,it comes down to whether or not you trust dumbledore's judgement.
9822,Remus Lupin,he trusts snape.
9823,Remus Lupin,therefore i do.
9824,Harry Potter,but dumbledore can make mistakes.
9825,Harry Potter,he's said it himself --
9826,Remus Lupin,you're blinded by hatred.
9827,Harry Potter,i'm not --
9828,Remus Lupin,you are!
9829,Remus Lupin,people are disappearing harry.
9830,Remus Lupin,daily.
9831,Remus Lupin,we can only put our trust in a handful of people.
9832,Remus Lupin,if we start fighting amongst ourselves we're doomed.
9833,Ginny Weasley,open up you.
9834,Ginny Weasley,don't trust me?
9835,Harry Potter,it's good.
9836,Ginny Weasley,'course 'tis.
9837,Ginny Weasley,made them myself.
9838,Arthur Weasley,you'll have to forgive remus.
9839,Arthur Weasley,it takes its toll -- his condition.
9840,Harry Potter,are you alright mr. weasley?
9841,Arthur Weasley,we're being followed all of us.
9842,Arthur Weasley,molly doesn't leave the house most days.
9843,Arthur Weasley,it's not been easy.
9844,Harry Potter,did you get my owl?
9845,Arthur Weasley,yes but i thought it best if i replied in person.
9846,Arthur Weasley,if dumbledore's traveling it's news to the ministry.
9847,Arthur Weasley,but perhaps that's the way dumbledore wants it.
9848,Arthur Weasley,as for draco malfoy -- i know a bit more.
9849,Harry Potter,go on.
9850,Arthur Weasley,i sent an agent to borgin & burkes.
9851,Arthur Weasley,from what you describe i think what you and ron saw at the end of the summer -- the object that draco seemed so interested in -- was a vanishing cabinet.
9852,Harry Potter,a vanishing cabinet?
9853,Arthur Weasley,they were all the rage when voldemort first rose to power.
9854,Arthur Weasley,you can imagine the appeal.
9855,Arthur Weasley,should the death eaters come calling one needed only slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.
9856,Arthur Weasley,but they're tricky contraptions.
9857,Arthur Weasley,require a tremendous amount of looking after.
9858,Arthur Weasley,eventually they fell out of favor.
9859,Harry Potter,what happened to it?
9860,Harry Potter,the one at borgin & burkes?
9861,Arthur Weasley,nothing.
9862,Arthur Weasley,it's still there.
9863,Arthur Weasley,harry.
9864,Arthur Weasley,you know i went through all this before -- the last time around.
9865,Arthur Weasley,times like these -- dark times -- do funny things to people.
9866,Arthur Weasley,it can bring them together and it can tear them apart.
9867,Arthur Weasley,things... speed up.
9868,Arthur Weasley,it's what happens when you don't know if today will be your last.
9869,Nymphadora Tonks,it was delicious molly.
9870,Nymphadora Tonks,really.
9871,Molly Weasley,you're sure you won't stay?
9872,Nymphadora Tonks,no we should go.
9873,Nymphadora Tonks,the first night of the cycle is always the worst --
9874,Molly Weasley,remus...?
9875,Ginny Weasley,everyone gone to bed?
9876,Harry Potter,soon.
9877,Ginny Weasley,i don't sleep these days.
9878,Ginny Weasley,so i wash my hair.
9879,Ginny Weasley,silly right?
9880,Ginny Weasley,happy christmas harry.
9881,Nymphadora Tonks,sweetheart...
9882,Remus Lupin,there's someone out there.
9883,Remus Lupin,i can smell him.
9884,Remus Lupin,there's more than one --
9885,Ginny Weasley,oh my god...
9886,Arthur Weasley,harry no!
9887,Nymphadora Tonks,remus!
9888,Arthur Weasley,ginny stay with your mother!
9889,Ginny Weasley,no harry!
9890,Ginny Weasley,it's a trap!
9891,Fenrir Greyback,don't you smell clean.
9892,Hermione Granger,you have to realize who you are harry.
9893,Harry Potter,i know who i am hermione alright?
9894,Hermione Granger,sorry.
9895,Hermione Granger,so tell me what arthur said.
9896,Harry Potter,if dumbledore's traveling places it's news to the ministry.
9897,Harry Potter,but get this:  that night at borgin & burkes?
9898,Harry Potter,it seems draco was looking at a vanishing cabinet.
9899,Hermione Granger,what would draco want with a vanishing cabinet?
9900,Harry Potter,you tell me.
9901,Hermione Granger,he looks different don't you think?
9902,Hermione Granger,draco.
9903,Hermione Granger,almost... ill.
9904,Harry Potter,who could tell the difference?
9905,Ron Weasley,lav c'mon.
9906,Ron Weasley,of course i'll wear it.
9907,Lavender Brown,that's my won-won.
9908,Hermione Granger,excuse me i have to go vomit.
9909,Voldemort,sir is it true that professor merrythought is retiring?
9910,Horace Slughorn,now tom i couldn't tell you if i knew could i?
9911,Horace Slughorn,i must say m'boy i'd like to know where you get your information.
9912,Horace Slughorn,more knowledgeable than half the staff you are.
9913,Horace Slughorn,by the way thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?
9914,Voldemort,intuition.
9915,Horace Slughorn,good gracious look at the time.
9916,Horace Slughorn,off you go boys or professor dippett will have us all in detention.
9917,Horace Slughorn,lestrange avery don't forget your essays...
9918,Horace Slughorn,look sharp tom.
9919,Horace Slughorn,you don't want to be caught out of bed after hours...
9920,Voldemort,i know a secret shortcut or two.
9921,Horace Slughorn,yes i imagine you do.
9922,Horace Slughorn,something on your mind tom?
9923,Voldemort,yes sir.
9924,Voldemort,i couldn't think of anyone else to go to.
9925,Voldemort,the other professors well they're not like you.
9926,Voldemort,they might... misunderstand.
9927,Horace Slughorn,go on.
9928,Voldemort,i was in the library the other night in the restricted section and i read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic and i thought perhaps you could illuminate me...
9929,Horace Slughorn,i don't know anything about such things and i wouldn't tell you if i did!
9930,Horace Slughorn,now get out of here at once and don't ever let me catch you mentioning it again!
9931,Albus Dumbledore,confused?
9932,Albus Dumbledore,i would be surprised if you weren't.
9933,Harry Potter,i don't understand -- what happened?
9934,Albus Dumbledore,this is perhaps the most important memory i've collected.
9935,Albus Dumbledore,it's also a lie.
9936,Albus Dumbledore,this memory has been tampered with.
9937,Albus Dumbledore,in this case by the person whose memory it is our friend professor slughorn.
9938,Harry Potter,but why would he tamper with his own memory?
9939,Albus Dumbledore,i suspect he is ashamed of it.
9940,Harry Potter,why?
9941,Albus Dumbledore,why indeed.
9942,Albus Dumbledore,i asked you to get to know professor slughorn and you've done so.
9943,Albus Dumbledore,now i want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory.
9944,Albus Dumbledore,any way you can.
9945,Harry Potter,i don't know him that well sir --
9946,Albus Dumbledore,you're the chosen one harry.
9947,Albus Dumbledore,and horace is at heart a decent man.
9948,Albus Dumbledore,provide the proper circumstances and he will confess his sins.
9949,Albus Dumbledore,this memory is everything harry.
9950,Albus Dumbledore,without it we are blind.
9951,Albus Dumbledore,without it we leave the fate of our world to chance.
9952,Albus Dumbledore,you have no choice.
9953,Albus Dumbledore,you must not fail.
9954,Horace Slughorn,now don't forget to look over the chapter on antidotes.
9955,Horace Slughorn,i'll be poisoning one of you next time we meet.
9956,Horace Slughorn,i'm joking!
9957,Horace Slughorn,off you go!
9958,Horace Slughorn,don't forget your rattails miss alys.
9959,Horace Slughorn,ah!
9960,Horace Slughorn,if it isn't the prince of potions himself!
9961,Horace Slughorn,to what do i owe the pleasure?
9962,Harry Potter,well sir i wondered if i might ask you something.
9963,Horace Slughorn,ask away my dear boy ask away!
9964,Harry Potter,well you see the other day i was in the restricted section -- in the library -- and i stumbled upon something rather odd while reading.
9965,Harry Potter,something about a bit of rare magic...
9966,Horace Slughorn,yes?
9967,Horace Slughorn,and exactly what was this rare magic.
9968,Harry Potter,i'm not sure... that is i don't recall the name... exactly.
9969,Harry Potter,but it got me wondering... are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach?
9970,Horace Slughorn,i'm a potions professor harry.
9971,Horace Slughorn,perhaps your question would best be posed to professor snape.
9972,Harry Potter,yes well we don't exactly see eye-to-eye sir.
9973,Harry Potter,what i mean to say is he's not like you.
9974,Harry Potter,he might... misunderstand.
9975,Horace Slughorn,there can be no light without the dark.
9976,Horace Slughorn,and so it is with magic.
9977,Horace Slughorn,myself i have always strived to live within the light.
9978,Horace Slughorn,i suggest you do the same.
9979,Harry Potter,did you say the same to tom riddle sir?
9980,Harry Potter,when he came asking questions.
9981,Horace Slughorn,dumbledore put you up to this.
9982,Horace Slughorn,didn't he?
9983,Horace Slughorn,didn't he!
9984,Harry Potter,sir --
9985,Hermione Granger,dead.
9986,Hermione Granger,did you actually expect you could just walk up to ol' sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest darkest secret?
9987,Hermione Granger,honestly harry sometimes i think the daily prophet should call you the dim one.
9988,Harry Potter,nice.
9989,Hermione Granger,you're going to have to persuade him somehow.
9990,Hermione Granger,and now i'm afraid you've made it a lot harder.
9991,Harry Potter,hermione.
9992,Harry Potter,i think malfoy's leaving the castle.
9993,Harry Potter,i've seen it.
9994,Harry Potter,sometimes... sometimes he just disappears off the map.
9995,Hermione Granger,that's... not possible.
9996,Hermione Granger,no one can leave the castle these days.
9997,Hermione Granger,the map is wrong.
9998,Harry Potter,the map is never wrong.
9999,Ron Weasley,it's beautiful isn't it?
10000,Ron Weasley,the moon.
10001,Harry Potter,divine.
10002,Harry Potter,had ourselves a little late-night snack did we?
10003,Ron Weasley,it was on your bed.
10004,Ron Weasley,the box.
10005,Ron Weasley,thought i'd try one...
10006,Harry Potter,or twenty.
10007,Ron Weasley,i can't stop thinking about her harry.
10008,Harry Potter,really?
10009,Harry Potter,honestly i reckoned she was starting to annoy you.
10010,Ron Weasley,she could never annoy me.
10011,Ron Weasley,i think... i think i love her.
10012,Harry Potter,excuse me?
10013,Harry Potter,well... brilliant.
10014,Ron Weasley,do you think she knows i exist?
10015,Harry Potter,bloody well hope so.
10016,Harry Potter,she's been snogging you for three months.
10017,Ron Weasley,snogging?
10018,Ron Weasley,who're you talking about?
10019,Harry Potter,who're you talking about?
10020,Ron Weasley,romilda of course.
10021,Ron Weasley,romilda vane.
10022,Harry Potter,okay.
10023,Harry Potter,very funny.
10024,Harry Potter,what the hell was that for?
10025,Ron Weasley,it's no joke!
10026,Ron Weasley,i'm in love with her!
10027,Harry Potter,okay!
10028,Harry Potter,fine!
10029,Harry Potter,you're in love with her!
10030,Harry Potter,have you ever actually met her!
10031,Ron Weasley,no.
10032,Ron Weasley,can you introduce me?
10033,Harry Potter,ron these chocolates they're -- c'mon.
10034,Harry Potter,i'm going to introduce you to romilda vane.
10035,Ron Weasley,how do i look?
10036,Harry Potter,devastatingly handsome.
10037,Horace Slughorn,damn it all!
10038,Horace Slughorn,yes???!!!!
10039,Horace Slughorn,oh.
10040,Horace Slughorn,potter.
10041,Horace Slughorn,it's you.
10042,Horace Slughorn,i'm afraid i'm busy at the moment --
10043,Harry Potter,sir.
10044,Harry Potter,i'm sorry.
10045,Harry Potter,i wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely --
10046,Ron Weasley,where's romilda?
10047,Horace Slughorn,what's the matter with wenby?
10048,Horace Slughorn,ah.
10049,Horace Slughorn,very well.
10050,Horace Slughorn,bring him in.
10051,Horace Slughorn,i'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time harry -- an expert potioneer like you.
10052,Harry Potter,i figured this called for a more practiced hand sir.
10053,Ron Weasley,hello darling.
10054,Ron Weasley,fancy a drink?
10055,Horace Slughorn,hm.
10056,Horace Slughorn,perhaps you're right.
10057,Harry Potter,i'm sorry sir.
10058,Harry Potter,about the other day.
10059,Harry Potter,our... misunderstanding.
10060,Horace Slughorn,yes well water under the bridge as they say correct?
10061,Harry Potter,i mean i'm sure you're tired of it after all these years.
10062,Harry Potter,the questions.
10063,Harry Potter,about... voldemort.
10064,Horace Slughorn,i'll ask you not to use that name.
10065,Harry Potter,yes sir.
10066,Harry Potter,it's just well dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.
10067,Harry Potter,it seemed sensible.
10068,Horace Slughorn,with all due respect dumbledore sometimes forgets that most of us do not possess powers so great that we can risk offending the most dangerous dark lord who ever lived.
10069,Horace Slughorn,alright m'boy!
10070,Horace Slughorn,bottoms up!
10071,Ron Weasley,what's this?
10072,Horace Slughorn,a tonic for the nerves.
10073,Ron Weasley,what happened to me?
10074,Harry Potter,love potion.
10075,Horace Slughorn,and a bloody strong one at that.
10076,Ron Weasley,i feel really... bad.
10077,Horace Slughorn,pick-me-up's what you need m'boy.
10078,Horace Slughorn,do us all good i think.
10079,Horace Slughorn,i've got butterbeer wine -- ah -- and a dazzling oak-matured mead.
10080,Horace Slughorn,i had other intentions for this but given the circumstances...
10081,Horace Slughorn,there we are potter.
10082,Horace Slughorn,to life!
10083,Harry Potter,ron!
10084,Harry Potter,ron!!!
10085,Harry Potter,professor help him!
10086,Horace Slughorn,i d-don't understand --
10087,Harry Potter,professor!
10088,Harry Potter,do something!
10090,Harry Potter,he's choking!
10092,Harry Potter,breathe!
10093,Harry Potter,c'mon ron don't be a prat.
10094,Harry Potter,breathe!
10095,Harry Potter,breathe!
10096,Ron Weasley,these girls are gonna kill me harry.
10097,Albus Dumbledore,quick thinking on your part harry.
10098,Albus Dumbledore,using a bezoar.
10099,Albus Dumbledore,you must be very proud of your student eh horace?
10100,Horace Slughorn,hm?
10101,Horace Slughorn,oh.
10102,Horace Slughorn,yes... very proud.
10103,Minerva McGonagall,i think we all agree that mr. potter's actions were heroic.
10104,Minerva McGonagall,the question is:  why were they necessary.
10105,Albus Dumbledore,why indeed.
10106,Albus Dumbledore,this appears to be a gift horace.
10107,Albus Dumbledore,you don't by chance remember who gave you this bottle do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison.
10108,Horace Slughorn,actually i had intended to give it as a gift myself.
10109,Albus Dumbledore,to whom might i ask?
10110,Horace Slughorn,you headmaster.
10111,Lavender Brown,where is he?
10112,Lavender Brown,where's my won-won!
10113,Lavender Brown,has he been asking for me?
10114,Lavender Brown,what's she doing here?
10115,Hermione Granger,i might ask you the same.
10116,Lavender Brown,i happen to be his girlfriend.
10117,Hermione Granger,i happen to be his... friend.
10118,Lavender Brown,don't make me laugh.
10119,Lavender Brown,you haven't spoken in weeks.
10120,Lavender Brown,i suppose you want to make up with him now that he's suddenly all interesting.
10121,Hermione Granger,he's been poisoned you daft dimbo!
10122,Hermione Granger,and for the record i've always found him interesting.
10123,Lavender Brown,ha!
10124,Lavender Brown,see?
10125,Lavender Brown,he senses my presence.
10126,Lavender Brown,i'm here won-won.

10141,Ron Weasley,tell me again how i broke up with lavender?
10142,Hermione Granger,um well she came to visit you in the hospital you see and you talked -- i don't believe it was a long conversation --
10143,Ron Weasley,don't get me wrong.
10144,Ron Weasley,i'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.
10145,Ron Weasley,it's just she seems... a bit put out.
10146,Hermione Granger,does doesn't she?
10147,Hermione Granger,and you say you don't remember a thing from that night?
10148,Hermione Granger,not one thing?
10149,Ron Weasley,well... there is... something.
10150,Ron Weasley,but no.
10151,Ron Weasley,it can't be.
10152,Ron Weasley,besides i was completely boggled wasn't i?
10153,Hermione Granger,right.
10154,Hermione Granger,boggled...
10155,Hermione Granger,that's katie.
10156,Hermione Granger,that's katie bell.
10157,Harry Potter,how are you katie?
10158,Katie Bell,give me a moment girls.
10159,Katie Bell,i know you're going to ask harry.
10160,Katie Bell,but i don't know who cursed me.
10161,Katie Bell,i've tried to remember.
10162,Katie Bell,honestly.
10163,Katie Bell,but i just... can't...
10164,Draco Malfoy,cruci--
10165,Harry Potter,sectumsempra!
10166,Draco Malfoy,don't touch me!
10167,Draco Malfoy,don't you dare touch me!
10168,Ginny Weasley,you have to get rid of it.
10169,Ginny Weasley,today.
10170,Ginny Weasley,take my hand.
10171,Harry Potter,the room of requirement...
10172,Ginny Weasley,over the years if someone had a secret if they wanted to conceal something this is where they came.
10173,Ginny Weasley,some of these things are almost as old as the castle itself.
10174,Harry Potter,who showed you this?
10175,Harry Potter,first.
10176,Ginny Weasley,fred and george.
10177,Ginny Weasley,first year.
10178,Ginny Weasley,i hid tom riddle's diary here for a time.
10179,Ginny Weasley,wish i'd left it...
10180,Ginny Weasley,what was that?
10181,Ginny Weasley,see you never know what you'll find up here.
10182,Ginny Weasley,all right.
10183,Ginny Weasley,close your eyes.
10184,Ginny Weasley,that way you can't be tempted.
10185,Ginny Weasley,there's something else.
10186,Ginny Weasley,another secret of sorts.
10187,Ginny Weasley,one of mine...
10188,Ginny Weasley,that can stay hidden up here too if you like.
10189,Ron Weasley,so.
10190,Ron Weasley,did you and ginny do it?
10191,Harry Potter,what?
10192,Ron Weasley,you know.
10193,Ron Weasley,hide the book.
10194,Harry Potter,oh.
10195,Harry Potter,yeah.
10196,Ron Weasley,still no luck with slughorn i take it?
10197,Harry Potter,say that again.
10198,Hermione Granger,well?
10199,Hermione Granger,how do you feel?
10200,Harry Potter,excellent.
10201,Harry Potter,really excellent.
10202,Hermione Granger,now remember.
10203,Hermione Granger,slughorn usually eats early takes a short walk and then returns to his office.
10204,Harry Potter,right.
10205,Harry Potter,i'm going down to hagrid's.
10206,Hermione Granger,what?
10207,Hermione Granger,no harry -- you've got to go see slughorn.
10208,Hermione Granger,we have a plan --
10209,Harry Potter,no.
10210,Harry Potter,i've got a good feeling about going to hagrid's.
10211,Harry Potter,i feel like it's the place to be tonight know what i mean?
10212,Hermione Granger,no.
10213,Ron Weasley,no.
10214,Harry Potter,trust me.
10215,Harry Potter,i know what i'm doing.
10216,Harry Potter,or at least felix does.
10217,Horace Slughorn,merlin's beard harry!
10218,Harry Potter,sorry sir.
10219,Harry Potter,i should've announced myself.
10220,Harry Potter,cleared my throat.
10221,Harry Potter,coughed.
10222,Harry Potter,you probably feared i was madam sprout.
10223,Horace Slughorn,well yes actually -- why would you think that?
10224,Harry Potter,just the general behavior sir.
10225,Harry Potter,the sneaking around.
10226,Harry Potter,the jumping when you saw me.
10227,Harry Potter,by the way those tentacula leaves -- they're quite valuable aren't they?
10228,Horace Slughorn,ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer -- not that i'm familiar with such back alley transactions.
10229,Horace Slughorn,one hears rumors is all.
10230,Horace Slughorn,my own interests are purely academic of course.
10231,Harry Potter,personally these plants have always kind of freaked me out.
10232,Horace Slughorn,exactly how did you get out of the castle harry?
10233,Harry Potter,through the front doors sir.
10234,Harry Potter,i'm off to hagrid's you see.
10235,Harry Potter,he's a very dear friend and i felt like paying him a visit.
10236,Harry Potter,so if you don't mind i'll be going.
10237,Horace Slughorn,harry!
10238,Harry Potter,sir?
10239,Horace Slughorn,it's nearly nightfall.
10240,Horace Slughorn,surely you realize i can't allow you to roam the grounds all by yourself.
10241,Harry Potter,well then by all means come along sir.
10242,Horace Slughorn,harry i must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!
10243,Harry Potter,that would be counterproductive sir.
10244,Horace Slughorn,and what makes you say that?
10245,Harry Potter,no idea.
10246,Horace Slughorn,merlin's beard...
10247,Horace Slughorn,is that an actual acromantula?
10248,Harry Potter,a dead one i think sir.
10249,Rubeus Hagrid,'arry.
10250,Rubeus Hagrid,'orace.
10251,Horace Slughorn,my god dear man.
10252,Horace Slughorn,how did you ever manage to kill it?
10253,Rubeus Hagrid,kill 'im!
10254,Rubeus Hagrid,me oldest friend 'e was!
10255,Horace Slughorn,i'm sorry i... didn't realize.
10256,Rubeus Hagrid,ah don' worry yerself.
10257,Rubeus Hagrid,yer not alone.
10258,Rubeus Hagrid,seriously misunderstood creatures -- spiders.
10259,Rubeus Hagrid,it's the eyes i reckon.
10260,Rubeus Hagrid,unnerve people.
10261,Harry Potter,not to mention the pincers.
10262,Rubeus Hagrid,i reckon that too... how'd yeh get outta the castle anyways?
10263,Harry Potter,through the front doors.
10264,Horace Slughorn,hagrid.
10265,Horace Slughorn,i wouldn't want to be indelicate but acromantula venom is uncommonly rare and well if you wouldn't mind my extracting a vial or two -- purely for academic pursuits...
10266,Rubeus Hagrid,don' suppose it's doin' 'im any good izzit?
10267,Horace Slughorn,my thoughts exactly!
10268,Horace Slughorn,always carry a few spare ampoules for just such occasions.
10269,Horace Slughorn,old potion master's habit you know...
10270,Rubeus Hagrid,wish yeh coulda seen 'im in 'is prime.
10271,Rubeus Hagrid,magnificent 'e was.
10272,Rubeus Hagrid,jus' magnificent...
10273,Horace Slughorn,why don't i say a few words?
10274,Horace Slughorn,i trust he had family?
10275,Harry Potter,oh yeah.
10276,Horace Slughorn,farewell...
10277,Rubeus Hagrid,aragog.
10278,Horace Slughorn,farewell aragog king of arachnids.
10279,Horace Slughorn,though your body will decay your spirit lingers on in the quiet web-spun places of your forest home.
10280,Horace Slughorn,may your many-eyed descendents ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained.
10281,Rubeus Hagrid,tha' was... tha' was... beautiful.
10282,Horace Slughorn,and odo the hero they bore him back home...
10283,Rubeus Hagrid,to the place he'd known as a lad they laid him to rest with his hat inside out and his wand snapped in two which was sad...
10284,Rubeus Hagrid,i had 'im from an egg yeh know.
10285,Rubeus Hagrid,tiny little thing he was when he hatched.
10286,Rubeus Hagrid,no bigger'n a pekinese.
10287,Horace Slughorn,sweet.
10288,Horace Slughorn,i once had a fish.
10289,Horace Slughorn,francis.
10290,Horace Slughorn,lovely little thing.
10291,Horace Slughorn,one day i came downstairs and he'd vanished.
10292,Horace Slughorn,poof.
10293,Rubeus Hagrid,tha's odd.
10294,Horace Slughorn,isn't it?
10295,Horace Slughorn,that's life i suppose.
10296,Horace Slughorn,one goes along and then... poof.
10297,Horace Slughorn,that's never unicorn hair hagrid?
10298,Horace Slughorn,hagrid looks up reels a bit.
10299,Horace Slughorn,nods.
10300,Horace Slughorn,but my dear chap do you know how much that's worth?
10301,Rubeus Hagrid,no idea... no idea at all...
10302,Horace Slughorn,it was a student who gave me francis.
10303,Horace Slughorn,one spring afternoon i discovered a bowl upon my desk with a few inches of clear water.
10304,Horace Slughorn,there was a flower petal floating upon the surface.
10305,Horace Slughorn,as i watched the petal sank but just before it touched bottom... it transformed.
10306,Horace Slughorn,into a wee fish.
10307,Horace Slughorn,it was beautiful magic wondrous to behold.
10308,Horace Slughorn,the petal had come from a lily.
10309,Horace Slughorn,your mother.
10310,Horace Slughorn,the day i came downstairs the day i found the bowl empty... was the day she...
10311,Horace Slughorn,i know what you want.
10312,Horace Slughorn,but i can't give it to you.
10313,Horace Slughorn,it will ruin me...
10314,Harry Potter,do you know why i survived?
10315,Harry Potter,the night i got this.
10316,Harry Potter,because of her.
10317,Harry Potter,because she sacrificed herself.
10318,Harry Potter,because she refused to step aside.
10319,Harry Potter,because her love was more powerful than voldemort.
10320,Horace Slughorn,please don't say his --
10321,Harry Potter,i'm not afraid of the name professor.
10322,Harry Potter,and i'm not afraid of him.
10323,Harry Potter,and you shouldn't be either.
10324,Harry Potter,she didn't just die for me that night.
10325,Harry Potter,she died for you too.
10326,Harry Potter,she died for everyone who's ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a death eater waited on their doorstep.
10327,Harry Potter,professor.
10328,Harry Potter,i'm going to tell you something something others have only guessed at.
10329,Harry Potter,it's true.
10330,Harry Potter,i am the chosen one.
10331,Harry Potter,only i can kill him.
10332,Harry Potter,but in order to do so i need to know what tom riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago.
10333,Harry Potter,and i need to know what you told him.
10334,Harry Potter,be brave professor.
10335,Harry Potter,be brave like my mother.
10336,Harry Potter,otherwise you disgrace her.
10337,Harry Potter,otherwise she died for nothing.
10338,Harry Potter,otherwise the bowl remains empty forever.
10339,Horace Slughorn,don't think too badly of me once you've seen it.
10340,Horace Slughorn,you don't know what he was like... even then.
10341,Albus Dumbledore,how is he?
10342,Albus Dumbledore,horace?
10343,Voldemort,sir is it true that professor merrythought is retiring?
10344,Horace Slughorn,now tom i couldn't tell you if i knew could i?
10345,Horace Slughorn,i must say m'boy i'd like to know where you get your information.
10346,Horace Slughorn,more knowledgable than half the staff you are.
10347,Horace Slughorn,by the way thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?
10348,Voldemort,intuition.
10349,Horace Slughorn,good gracious is it that time already?
10350,Horace Slughorn,off you go boys or professor dippett will have us all in detention.
10351,Horace Slughorn,lestrange avery don't forget your essays...
10352,Horace Slughorn,look sharp tom.
10353,Horace Slughorn,you don't want to be caught out of bed after hours...
10354,Voldemort,i know a secret shortcut or two.
10355,Horace Slughorn,yes i imagine you do.
10356,Horace Slughorn,something on your mind tom?
10357,Voldemort,yes sir.
10358,Voldemort,i couldn't think of anyone else to go to.
10359,Voldemort,the other professors well they're not like you.
10360,Voldemort,they might... misunderstand.
10361,Horace Slughorn,go on.
10362,Voldemort,i was in the library the other night in the restricted section and i read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic and i thought perhaps you could illuminate me.
10363,Voldemort,it's called as i understand it... a horcrux.
10364,Horace Slughorn,excuse me?
10365,Voldemort,horcrux.
10366,Voldemort,i came across the term while reading and i didn't fully understand it.
10367,Horace Slughorn,i'm not sure what you were reading tom but that's very dark stuff very dark indeed.
10368,Voldemort,yes sir.
10369,Voldemort,which is why i came to you.
10370,Voldemort,i mean no disrespect to the rest of the staff but i thought if anyone could tell me... it would be you.
10371,Horace Slughorn,a horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.
10372,Voldemort,yes i thought it might be something like that.
10373,Voldemort,but i don't understand how that works sir.
10374,Horace Slughorn,one splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object.
10375,Horace Slughorn,by doing so you are protected should you be attacked and your body destroyed.
10376,Voldemort,protected?
10377,Horace Slughorn,that part of your soul that was hidden lives on.
10378,Horace Slughorn,in other words you cannot die.
10379,Voldemort,how does one split his soul sir?
10380,Horace Slughorn,i think you can guess the answer to that tom.
10381,Voldemort,murder.
10382,Horace Slughorn,yes.
10383,Horace Slughorn,killing rips the soul apart.
10384,Horace Slughorn,it is a violation against nature.
10385,Horace Slughorn,after one is never the same.
10386,Voldemort,out of curiosity sir -- can you only split your soul once?
10387,Voldemort,for instance isn't seven the most powerfully magical number --
10388,Horace Slughorn,seven!
10389,Horace Slughorn,merlin's beard tom!
10390,Horace Slughorn,isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person?
10391,Horace Slughorn,to rip the soul into seven pieces...
10392,Horace Slughorn,this is all hypothetical isn't it tom?
10393,Horace Slughorn,all academic...
10394,Voldemort,of course sir.
10395,Voldemort,and i promise i'll not speak of our conversation.
10396,Voldemort,it'll be our little secret...
10397,Harry Potter,sir --
10398,Albus Dumbledore,this is beyond anything i imagined.
10399,Albus Dumbledore,in my life i have seen things that are unimaginably horrific.
10400,Albus Dumbledore,i know now... you will see worse.
10401,Harry Potter,do you mean to say he succeeded sir?
10402,Harry Potter,in making a horcrux?
10403,Albus Dumbledore,oh he succeeded.
10404,Albus Dumbledore,and not just once.
10405,Albus Dumbledore,think harry.
10406,Albus Dumbledore,he's just told us.
10407,Harry Potter,seven.
10408,Harry Potter,he made seven -- the most powerfully magical number.
10409,Harry Potter,but... what are they exactly?
10410,Albus Dumbledore,they can be anything.
10411,Albus Dumbledore,the most commonplace of objects.
10412,Albus Dumbledore,a ring for example.
10413,Albus Dumbledore,or a book...
10414,Harry Potter,tom riddle's diary --
10415,Albus Dumbledore,it's a horcrux yes.
10416,Albus Dumbledore,four years ago when you saved ginny weasley's life in the chamber of secrets when you brought me this i knew.
10417,Albus Dumbledore,this was a different kind of magic.
10418,Albus Dumbledore,very dark.
10419,Albus Dumbledore,very powerful.
10420,Albus Dumbledore,but until tonight i had no idea just how powerful...
10421,Harry Potter,and the ring...?
10422,Albus Dumbledore,belonged to voldemort's mother.
10423,Albus Dumbledore,it was difficult to find and...
10424,Harry Potter,... even more difficult to destroy.
10425,Harry Potter,but if you could find them all.
10426,Harry Potter,if you did destroy each horcrux...
10427,Albus Dumbledore,one destroys voldemort.
10428,Harry Potter,but how would you find them?
10429,Harry Potter,they could be hidden anywhere couldn't they...
10430,Albus Dumbledore,true.
10431,Albus Dumbledore,but magic especially dark magic...
10432,Albus Dumbledore,... leaves traces.
10433,Harry Potter,it's where you've been going isn't it sir?
10434,Harry Potter,when you leave the school.
10435,Albus Dumbledore,yes.
10436,Albus Dumbledore,and i think... perhaps... i may have found another.
10437,Albus Dumbledore,but this time i cannot hope to destroy it alone.
10438,Albus Dumbledore,once again i shall ask too much of you.
10439,Hermione Granger,harry.
10440,Hermione Granger,it's time.
10441,Harry Potter,hermione is the room of requirement unplottable?
10442,Hermione Granger,if one wants it to be.
10443,Hermione Granger,why?
10444,Harry Potter,it would explain why i thought malfoy was leaving the castle when he disappeared off the map.
10445,Harry Potter,he was going to the room of requirement.
10446,Hermione Granger,of course and that explains the vanishing cabinet as well!
10447,Ron Weasley,no.
10448,Ron Weasley,i got an owl from dad this morning.
10449,Ron Weasley,the one at borgin & burke's?
10450,Ron Weasley,it's still there.
10451,Harry Potter,but i'm telling you.
10452,Harry Potter,i saw it --
10453,Harry Potter,what if there are two?
10454,Harry Potter,vanishing cabinets.
10455,Hermione Granger,what if there are?
10456,Harry Potter,i don't know...
10457,Ron Weasley,good luck mate.
10458,Harry Potter,i don't need luck.
10459,Harry Potter,i'll be with dumbledore.
10460,Severus Snape,have you ever considered that you ask too much?
10461,Severus Snape,that you take too much for granted?
10462,Severus Snape,has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that i don't want to do this anymore?
10463,Albus Dumbledore,whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.
10464,Albus Dumbledore,i will not negotiate this with you severus.
10465,Albus Dumbledore,you agreed.
10466,Albus Dumbledore,there's nothing more to discuss.
10467,Albus Dumbledore,harry.
10468,Albus Dumbledore,you need a shave my friend.
10469,Albus Dumbledore,at times i forget how much you've grown.
10470,Albus Dumbledore,at times i still see the small boy from the cupboard.
10471,Albus Dumbledore,forgive my mawkishness harry.
10472,Albus Dumbledore,i am an old man.
10473,Harry Potter,you look the same to me sir.
10474,Albus Dumbledore,like your mother you are unfailingly kind.
10475,Albus Dumbledore,a trait people never fail to undervalue.
10476,Albus Dumbledore,i'm afraid.
10477,Albus Dumbledore,the place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous harry.
10478,Albus Dumbledore,i promised that you could accompany me and i stand by that promise.
10479,Albus Dumbledore,but there is a condition:  you must obey any command i give you -- without question.
10480,Harry Potter,yes sir.
10481,Albus Dumbledore,understand what i'm saying.
10482,Albus Dumbledore,should i tell you to hide you must hide.
10483,Albus Dumbledore,should i tell you to run you will run.
10484,Albus Dumbledore,and should i tell you to abandon me and save yourself...
10485,Albus Dumbledore,you will do so.
10486,Albus Dumbledore,your word harry.
10487,Harry Potter,my word.
10488,Albus Dumbledore,take my arm.
10489,Harry Potter,sir i thought one couldn't apparate within hogwarts.
10490,Albus Dumbledore,being me has its privileges.
10491,Harry Potter,it's there isn't it?
10492,Albus Dumbledore,this is the place.
10493,Albus Dumbledore,oh yes this place has known magic.
10494,Albus Dumbledore,where you stand harry tom riddle once stood many many years ago when he was but a poor orphan boy with a penchant for cruelty...
10495,Albus Dumbledore,one wintry afternoon he lured two younger classmates to this cave.
10496,Albus Dumbledore,what happened is unclear.
10497,Albus Dumbledore,but this much is known:  the children were damaged.
10498,Harry Potter,sir!
10499,Albus Dumbledore,in order to gain passage payment must be made payment intended to weaken any intruder.
10500,Harry Potter,you should've let me sir.
10501,Albus Dumbledore,oh no harry.
10502,Albus Dumbledore,your blood is much more precious than mine.
10503,Albus Dumbledore,careful.
10504,Albus Dumbledore,the water.
10505,Albus Dumbledore,it's there.
10506,Albus Dumbledore,the only question is how do we get to it?
10507,Harry Potter,we couldn't perhaps just try a summoning charm sir?
10508,Harry Potter,accio horcrux!
10509,Albus Dumbledore,perhaps not.
10510,Albus Dumbledore,if you would harry...
10511,Harry Potter,sir... have you ever taken felix felicis?
10512,Albus Dumbledore,only recreationally.
10513,Albus Dumbledore,you see i believe one creates one's own luck.
10514,Harry Potter,professor... there are bodies in this lake.
10515,Albus Dumbledore,yes.
10516,Albus Dumbledore,remember... the water.
10517,Harry Potter,do you think the horcrux is in there sir?
10518,Albus Dumbledore,oh yes.
10519,Albus Dumbledore,it has to be drunk.
10520,Albus Dumbledore,you remember the condition on which i brought you with me?
10521,Albus Dumbledore,this potion might paralyze me.
10522,Albus Dumbledore,it might cause me to forget why i'm here.
10523,Albus Dumbledore,it might create so much pain i beg for relief.
10524,Albus Dumbledore,you are not to indulge these requests harry.
10525,Albus Dumbledore,it is your job to make sure i keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat.
10526,Albus Dumbledore,understood?
10527,Harry Potter,why can't i drink it sir?
10528,Albus Dumbledore,because i am much older much cleverer... and much less valuable.
10529,Albus Dumbledore,your good health harry.
10530,Harry Potter,professor?
10531,Harry Potter,professor?
10532,Harry Potter,can you hear me?
10533,Albus Dumbledore,don't... don't make me...
10534,Harry Potter,you... you can't stop professor.
10535,Harry Potter,you've got to keep drinking.
10536,Harry Potter,like you said.
10537,Harry Potter,remember.
10538,Albus Dumbledore,nooooooo!!
10540,Albus Dumbledore,make it stop... please... make it stop...
10541,Harry Potter,it will sir.
10542,Harry Potter,it'll stop.
10543,Harry Potter,but only if you drink...
10544,Albus Dumbledore,my fault.
10545,Albus Dumbledore,it's all my fault...
10546,Albus Dumbledore,too much... i can't... take it... i want... to die... kill... kill me... kill me harry!
10547,Harry Potter,what?
10548,Albus Dumbledore,your word harry!
10549,Albus Dumbledore,your word!
10550,Harry Potter,no...
10551,Albus Dumbledore,kill me!
10552,Albus Dumbledore,it's the only way!
10553,Harry Potter,one more.
10554,Harry Potter,just one more.
10555,Harry Potter,and then -- i promise... i'll do what you say.
10556,Harry Potter,i promise.
10557,Albus Dumbledore,water.
10558,Albus Dumbledore,water...
10559,Albus Dumbledore,aguamenti.
10560,Harry Potter,you did it sir.
10561,Harry Potter,look --
10562,Albus Dumbledore,water!
10563,Harry Potter,i'm trying sir.
10564,Harry Potter,i'm --
10565,Albus Dumbledore,go...
10566,Albus Dumbledore,we have to... go.
10567,Harry Potter,don't worry sir.
10568,Harry Potter,we're nearly there.
10569,Albus Dumbledore,i am not worried harry.
10570,Albus Dumbledore,i am with you.
10571,Minerva McGonagall,to your houses.
10572,Minerva McGonagall,no dawdling.
10573,Harry Potter,we need to get you up to the hospital sir to madam pomfrey --
10574,Albus Dumbledore,no.
10575,Albus Dumbledore,severus... severus is who i need... go and wake him... tell him what has happened...
10576,Albus Dumbledore,speak to no one else... i... i shall wait here...
10577,Harry Potter,all right.
10578,Harry Potter,okay.
10579,Harry Potter,sir are you... praying?
10580,Albus Dumbledore,no harry.
10581,Albus Dumbledore,i do not pray.
10582,Albus Dumbledore,i was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to apparate.
10583,Albus Dumbledore,hide yourself below.
10584,Albus Dumbledore,and do not speak or show yourself without my permission.
10585,Albus Dumbledore,no matter what.
10586,Albus Dumbledore,do as i say harry.
10587,Albus Dumbledore,trust me.
10588,Albus Dumbledore,good evening draco.
10589,Albus Dumbledore,what brings you out on such a fine spring evening?
10590,Albus Dumbledore,or is it summer?
10591,Draco Malfoy,who else is here?
10592,Draco Malfoy,i heard you talking.
10593,Albus Dumbledore,i often talk aloud to myself.
10594,Albus Dumbledore,i find it extraordinarily useful.
10595,Albus Dumbledore,that which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world to hear.
10596,Albus Dumbledore,haven't been whispering to yourself have you draco?
10597,Albus Dumbledore,you are not an assassin draco.
10598,Draco Malfoy,how do you know what i am?
10599,Draco Malfoy,i've done things that would shock you.
10600,Albus Dumbledore,like cursing katie bell and hoping she would in turn bear a cursed necklace to me?
10601,Albus Dumbledore,like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison.
10602,Albus Dumbledore,forgive me draco but these are attempts so feeble i cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them.
10603,Albus Dumbledore,i'm curious.
10604,Albus Dumbledore,when voldemort gave you this task when he asked you to kill me was it in a whisper?
10605,Draco Malfoy,he trusts me!
10606,Draco Malfoy,i was chosen!
10607,Albus Dumbledore,then i shall make it easy for you.
10608,Draco Malfoy,expelliarumus!
10609,Albus Dumbledore,well done draco.
10610,Albus Dumbledore,but i warn you.
10611,Albus Dumbledore,killing is not nearly as easy.
10612,Albus Dumbledore,you're not alone.
10613,Albus Dumbledore,are you.
10614,Albus Dumbledore,there are others.
10615,Albus Dumbledore,how?
10616,Draco Malfoy,the vanishing cabinet in the room of requirement.
10617,Albus Dumbledore,that cabinet has been broken for years.
10618,Draco Malfoy,i've been mending it.
10619,Albus Dumbledore,ingenious.
10620,Albus Dumbledore,let me guess.
10621,Albus Dumbledore,it has a sister.
10622,Albus Dumbledore,a twin.
10623,Draco Malfoy,in borgin & burkes.
10624,Draco Malfoy,they form --
10625,Albus Dumbledore,a passage yes.
10626,Albus Dumbledore,very good.
10627,Albus Dumbledore,i once knew a boy years ago who made all the wrong choices.
10628,Albus Dumbledore,let me help you draco.
10629,Draco Malfoy,i don't want your help!
10630,Draco Malfoy,don't you see!
10631,Draco Malfoy,i have to do it!
10632,Draco Malfoy,i have to!
10633,Draco Malfoy,i've got to kill you or he'll kill me.
10634,Albus Dumbledore,say that again draco.
10635,Albus Dumbledore,but aloud this time.
10636,Bellatrix Lestrange,well now look what we have here.
10637,Bellatrix Lestrange,dumbledore.
10638,Bellatrix Lestrange,wandless and alone.
10639,Bellatrix Lestrange,cornered in his own castle.
10640,Bellatrix Lestrange,well done draco.
10641,Albus Dumbledore,good evening bellatrix.
10642,Albus Dumbledore,i think introductions are in order.
10643,Bellatrix Lestrange,love to albus.
10644,Bellatrix Lestrange,but i'm afraid we're on a bit of a tight schedule.
10645,Fenrir Greyback,do it.
10646,Bellatrix Lestrange,he doesn't have the stomach.
10647,Bellatrix Lestrange,like his father.
10648,Bellatrix Lestrange,let me finish him.
10649,Bellatrix Lestrange,in my own way.
10650,Severus Snape,no!
10651,Severus Snape,the dark lord was clear.
10652,Severus Snape,the boy's to do it.
10653,Severus Snape,go on draco.
10654,Severus Snape,now!
10655,Severus Snape,no.
10656,Albus Dumbledore,severus...
10657,Bellatrix Lestrange,well look who's here.
10658,Bellatrix Lestrange,hogwarts own defense against the dark arts teacher.
10659,Bellatrix Lestrange,come to see the slaughter?
10660,Albus Dumbledore,severus... please.
10661,Severus Snape,i gave my word.
10662,Severus Snape,i made a vow...
10663,Severus Snape,avada kedavra!
10664,Severus Snape,you can no longer stay here.
10665,Bellatrix Lestrange,boo.
10666,Bellatrix Lestrange,draco!
10667,Bellatrix Lestrange,draco!
10668,Bellatrix Lestrange,they'll kill you if you stay.
10669,Severus Snape,go on!
10670,Severus Snape,go on!
10671,Harry Potter,cruciatus!
10672,Harry Potter,incacerata!
10673,Harry Potter,impedimenta!
10674,Harry Potter,fight!
10675,Harry Potter,fight back you coward!
10676,Severus Snape,don't ever associate that word and my name again.
10677,Severus Snape,no!
10678,Severus Snape,he belongs to the dark lord!
10679,Harry Potter,sectumsempra!
10680,Severus Snape,you dare use my own spells against me potter?
10681,Severus Snape,you may have gotten your mother's eyes but you're as dim as your father.
10682,Severus Snape,yes.
10683,Severus Snape,it's me.
10684,Severus Snape,i'm the half-blood prince.
10685,Harry Potter,hagrid... hagrid!
10686,Harry Potter,hagrid!
10687,Harry Potter,you alright?
10688,Rubeus Hagrid,take more'n tha' ter finish me off.
10689,Rubeus Hagrid,not sure about me 'ouse tho'.
10690,Rubeus Hagrid,but if anybody can put it righ' dumbledore can.
10691,Harry Potter,hagrid dumbledore --
10692,Rubeus Hagrid,only thing i can't reckon is wha' snape was doin' with tha' lot.
10693,Rubeus Hagrid,an' wha's this wi' the dark mar'?
10694,Rubeus Hagrid,who's been killed?
10695,Rubeus Hagrid,where's dumbledore 'arry?
10696,Rubeus Hagrid,where's dumbledore!
10698,Minerva McGonagall,potter.
10699,Minerva McGonagall,potter in light of what's happened... should you feel the need to talk to someone...
10700,Minerva McGonagall,you should know... professor dumbledore...
10701,Minerva McGonagall,you meant a great deal to him.
10702,Hermione Granger,dumbledore.
10703,Harry Potter,do you think he would've done it.
10704,Harry Potter,draco?
10705,Harry Potter,no.
10706,Harry Potter,he was lowering his wand.
10707,Harry Potter,in the end it was snape.
10708,Harry Potter,it was always snape.
10709,Harry Potter,and i did nothing...
10710,Hermione Granger,strange.
10711,Hermione Granger,thinking this is a piece of voldemort's soul...
10712,Harry Potter,yeah strange.
10713,Harry Potter,only... it's not.
10714,Harry Potter,it's a fake.
10715,Harry Potter,go on.
10716,Harry Potter,open it.
10717,Hermione Granger,'to the dark lord.
10718,Hermione Granger,i know i will be dead long before you read this but i want you to know that it was i who discovered your secret.
10719,Hermione Granger,i have stolen the real horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as i can.
10720,Hermione Granger,i face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more.
10721,Hermione Granger,r.a.b.'
10722,Harry Potter,dunno.
10723,Harry Potter,but whoever they are they have the real horcrux.
10724,Harry Potter,which means it was a waste.
10725,Harry Potter,all of it.
10726,Hermione Granger,ron's okay with it you know.
10727,Hermione Granger,you and ginny.
10728,Hermione Granger,but if i were you when he's around i'd keep the snogging to a minimum.
10729,Harry Potter,i'm not coming back hermione.
10730,Hermione Granger,we reckoned -- ron and me.
10731,Harry Potter,i have to finish what dumbledore started.
10732,Harry Potter,i'm not sure where that will lead me... but i'll let you and ron konw where i am -- when i can.
10733,Hermione Granger,i've always admired your courage harry but sometimes... you're really thick.
10734,Hermione Granger,you don't honestly think you can find all those horcruxes by yourself do you?
10735,Hermione Granger,you need us harry.
10736,Harry Potter,yeah.
10737,Harry Potter,i do.
10738,Harry Potter,but do me a favor.
10739,Harry Potter,when i'm around?
10740,Harry Potter,keep the snogging to a minimum.
10741,Hermione Granger,like that's going to happen.
10742,Hermione Granger,besides he's barking.
10743,Harry Potter,funny he says the same about you.
10744,Hermione Granger,yes but i'm exceptionally perceptive.
10745,Harry Potter,you're brilliant.
10746,Harry Potter,you both are.
10747,Hermione Granger,do you think we'll ever... come back?
10748,Harry Potter,i don’t know.
10749,Harry Potter,i never realised how beautiful this place was.
10750,Rufus Scrimgeour,these are dark times there is no denying.
10751,Rufus Scrimgeour,our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today.
10752,Rufus Scrimgeour,but i say this to our citizenry:  we ever your servants continue to defend your liberty and repel the forces that would seek to take it from you.
10753,Rufus Scrimgeour,your ministry remains strong...
10754,Mrs. Granger,hermione.
10755,Mrs. Granger,your tea is ready dear.
10756,Hermione Granger,coming mum.
10757,Mrs. Granger,don't you look lovely.
10758,Mrs. Granger,all packed?
10759,Mr. Granger,are you sure these biscuits are sugar-free?
10760,Mrs. Granger,quite sure dear.
10761,Mrs. Granger,see the big bold letters that say 'sugar free'?
10762,Mrs. Granger,dead giveaway.
10763,Mr. Granger,mm.
10764,Mr. Granger,yes.
10765,Mr. Granger,hello kitten.
10766,Mr. Granger,don't you look lovely.
10767,Mrs. Granger,darling don't be suspicious the biscuits taste so good be grateful the company's so clever...
10768,Hermione Granger,obliviate.
10769,Hermione Granger,goodbye.
10770,Ron Weasley,what are those?
10771,Arthur Weasley,close the door.
10772,Arthur Weasley,these are for the order.
10773,Arthur Weasley,so many are on the run now it helps them to stay connected with the rest of us.
10774,Arthur Weasley,know they're not alone...
10775,Ron Weasley,c'mon.
10776,Ron Weasley,mum's got dinner ready.
10777,Voldemort,severus.
10778,Voldemort,i was beginning to worry you'd lost your way.
10779,Voldemort,come.
10780,Voldemort,i've saved you a seat.
10781,Voldemort,you know our hosts of course severus.
10782,Voldemort,narcissa in particular has been most hospitable.
10783,Voldemort,lucius on the other hand is i fear burdened by my presence.
10784,Voldemort,are you lucius?
10785,Lucius Malfoy,my lord?
10786,Voldemort,are you burdened?
10787,Narcissa Malfoy,my lord is always welcome here.
10788,Voldemort,you bring news i trust severus?
10789,Severus Snape,it will happen saturday next.
10790,Severus Snape,at nightfall.
10791,Voldemort,and this information comes --
10792,Severus Snape,-- from the source we discussed.
10793,Corban Yaxley,i have heard differently my lord.
10794,Corban Yaxley,dawlish the auror let slip that the potter boy will not be moved until the thirtieth of this month the night before he turns seventeen.
10795,Severus Snape,this is a false trail.
10796,Severus Snape,the auror office no longer plays any part in the protection of harry potter.
10797,Severus Snape,those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the ministry.
10798,Death Eater,well they've got that right then 'aven't they?
10799,Voldemort,pius what say you?
10800,Pius Thicknesse,one hears many things my lord.
10801,Pius Thicknesse,whether the truth is among them is not clear.
10802,Voldemort,spoken like a true politician.
10803,Voldemort,you will i think prove most useful pius.
10804,Voldemort,where will he be taken?
10805,Voldemort,the boy?
10806,Severus Snape,to a safehouse.
10807,Severus Snape,likely the home of someone in the order.
10808,Severus Snape,i'm told it has been given every manner of protection possible.
10809,Severus Snape,once there it will be impractical to attack him.
10810,Severus Snape,we may have compromised the ministry but there are those who remain loyal to him.
10811,Severus Snape,as long as the ministry stands his allies within will have the means at their disposal to insure his safety.
10812,Bellatrix Lestrange,my lord if i might i'd like to volunteer myself for this task.
10813,Bellatrix Lestrange,i'd like to kill the boy.
10814,Voldemort,wormtail!
10815,Voldemort,have i not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?
10816,Peter Pettigrew,yes m-my lord.
10817,Peter Pettigrew,right away my lord.
10818,Voldemort,as inspiring as i find your bloodlust bellatrix i must be the one to kill harry potter.
10819,Voldemort,but i face an unfortunate complication.
10820,Voldemort,it has recently come to my attention that my wand and potter's share the same core.
10821,Voldemort,they are in some ways twins.
10822,Voldemort,we can wound but not fatally harm one another.
10823,Voldemort,which means if i am to kill him... i will have to do it with another's wand.
10824,Voldemort,come now.
10825,Voldemort,surely one of you would like the honor?
10826,Voldemort,what about... you lucius?
10827,Voldemort,i require your wand.
10828,Voldemort,do i detect elm?
10829,Lucius Malfoy,yes my lord.
10830,Voldemort,and the core?
10831,Lucius Malfoy,dragon -- dragon heartstring.
10832,Voldemort,my wand?
10833,Voldemort,you can't possibly think i would give you my wand.
10834,Lucius Malfoy,no my lord.
10835,Voldemort,for those of you who do not know we are joined tonight by miss charity burbage who until recently taught at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.
10836,Voldemort,her specialty was muggle studies.
10837,Voldemort,it is miss burbage's belief that muggles are not so different from us.
10838,Voldemort,she would given her way have us mate with them.
10839,Voldemort,to her the mixture of magical and muggle blood is not an abomination but something to be encouraged.
10840,Voldemort,i of course take a contrary view.
10841,Voldemort,but we're all civilized here.
10842,Voldemort,all adults.
10843,Voldemort,we can agree to disagree.
10844,Charity Burbage,severus please.
10845,Charity Burbage,we're friends...
10846,Voldemort,avada kedavra!
10847,Voldemort,nagini... dinner.
10848,Vernon Dursley,come now dudley.
10849,Vernon Dursley,hurry up!
10850,Harry Potter,time for the teary farewell.
10851,Petunia Dursley,i've lived in this house twenty years.
10852,Petunia Dursley,and now -- in a single night -- i'm expected to leave.
10853,Harry Potter,they'll torture you.
10854,Harry Potter,even dudley.
10855,Harry Potter,if they think you know where i'm going they'll stop at noth--
10856,Petunia Dursley,you think i don't know that?
10857,Petunia Dursley,you think i don't know what they're capable of?
10858,Petunia Dursley,you didn't just lose a mother that night in godric's hollow you know.
10859,Petunia Dursley,i lost a sister.
10860,Harry Potter,do you have any?
10861,Harry Potter,magic?
10862,Petunia Dursley,what a cruel thing to ask.
10863,Vernon Dursley,well this is goodbye then boy.
10864,Dudley Dursley,i don't understand.
10865,Dudley Dursley,isn't he coming with us?
10866,Vernon Dursley,who?
10867,Dudley Dursley,harry.
10868,Vernon Dursley,absolutely not.
10869,Dudley Dursley,why?
10870,Vernon Dursley,well because -- he doesn't want to do you boy?
10871,Harry Potter,absolutely not.
10872,Harry Potter,besides i'm just a waste of space.
10873,Harry Potter,isn't that right vernon?
10874,Vernon Dursley,come on dudley we're off.
10875,Dudley Dursley,i don't think you're a waste of space.
10876,Harry Potter,well... thanks.
10877,Harry Potter,see you big d.
10878,Harry Potter,good riddance.
10879,Rubeus Hagrid,all righ' 'arry?
10880,Rubeus Hagrid,yeh look fit.
10881,Alastor Moody,yeah he's ruddy gorgeous.
10882,Alastor Moody,what say we get undercover before someone murders him.
10883,Harry Potter,i thought you were looking after the prime minister kingsley.
10884,Kingsley Shacklebolt,you're more important.
10885,Bill Weasley,hello harry.
10886,Bill Weasley,bill weasley.
10887,Fred Weasley,wasn't always this handsome.
10888,George Weasley,dead ugly.
10889,Bill Weasley,true enough.
10890,Bill Weasley,owe it all to a werewolf by name of greyback.
10891,Bill Weasley,hope to repay the favor one day.
10892,Fleur Delacour,you are still beautiful to me william.
10893,Remus Lupin,just remember fleur once you're married:  bill takes his steaks on the raw side now.
10894,Nymphadora Tonks,my husband the joker.
10895,Nymphadora Tonks,by the way wait until you hear the news!
10896,Nymphadora Tonks,remus and i are --
10897,Alastor Moody,all right all right!
10898,Alastor Moody,you'll all have time for a cozy catch-up later!
10899,Alastor Moody,we've got to get the hell out of here and soon!
10900,Alastor Moody,potter you're underage which means you've still got the trace on you.
10901,Harry Potter,the trace?
10902,Alastor Moody,you sneeze and the ministry will know who wipes your nose.
10903,Alastor Moody,point is we have to use those means of transport the trace can't detect: brooms thestrals and the like.
10904,Alastor Moody,we'll go in pairs.
10905,Alastor Moody,that way if anyone's out there waiting for us -- and i reckon there will be -- they won't know which harry potter is the real one.
10906,Harry Potter,the real one...?
10907,Alastor Moody,i believe you're familiar with this particular brew.
10908,Harry Potter,no!
10909,Harry Potter,absolutely not!
10910,Hermione Granger,i told you he'd take it well.
10911,Harry Potter,if you think i'm going to let people risk their lives for me --
10912,Ron Weasley,never done that before have we?
10913,Harry Potter,this is different.
10914,Harry Potter,taking that.
10915,Harry Potter,becoming me -- no.
10916,Fred Weasley,well none of us really fancy it mate.
10917,George Weasley,yeah imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as scrawny specky gits forever.
10918,Alastor Moody,everyone here's of age potter and they've all agreed to take the risk.
10919,Mundungus Fletcher,technically i've been coerced.
10920,Mundungus Fletcher,mundungus fletcher mr. potter.
10921,Mundungus Fletcher,i've always been a huge admirer.
10922,Alastor Moody,nip it mundungus!
10923,Alastor Moody,all right granger as discussed.
10924,Harry Potter,blimey hermione!
10925,Alastor Moody,straight in here if you please.
10926,Alastor Moody,for those of you who haven't taken polyjuice potion before fair warning.
10927,Alastor Moody,it tastes like goblin piss.
10928,Fred Weasley,have a lot of experience with that do you mad-eye?
10929,Fred Weasley,just trying to defuse the tension.
10930,Fred Weasley,wow -- we're identical!
10931,George Weasley,wow -- we're identical!
10932,Alastor Moody,not yet you aren't.
10933,George Weasley,don't have something a bit more sporty do you?
10934,Fred Weasley,yes don't fancy this color at all.
10935,Alastor Moody,fancy this:  you're not you so shut it and strip.
10936,Alastor Moody,you'll need to change too potter.
10937,Fleur Delacour,bill look away -- i'm 'ideous.
10938,Ron Weasley,i knew ginny was lying about that tattoo.
10939,Hermione Granger,harry your eyesight really is awful.
10940,Alastor Moody,blimey.
10941,Alastor Moody,i almost forgot.
10942,Alastor Moody,right then.
10943,Alastor Moody,we'll be pairing off.
10944,Alastor Moody,each potter will have a protector.
10945,Alastor Moody,as for you harry...
10946,Harry Potter,yes?
10947,Alastor Moody,the real harry!
10948,Alastor Moody,where the devil are you anyway?
10949,Harry Potter,here.
10950,Alastor Moody,you'll ride with hagrid.
10951,Rubeus Hagrid,brought yeh here sixteen years ago when you were barely bigger than a bowtruckle.
10952,Rubeus Hagrid,seems only righ' i should be the one ter take yeh away.
10953,Alastor Moody,yeah it's all very touching.
10954,Alastor Moody,let's go.
10955,Alastor Moody,good luck everyone.
10956,Alastor Moody,on the count of three.
10957,Alastor Moody,one... two --
10958,Harry Potter,hagrid!
10959,Harry Potter,we've got to help the others!
10960,Rubeus Hagrid,can't do it 'arry.
10961,Rubeus Hagrid,my job's ter get you where we're goin' safe 'n sound -- mad-eye's orders!
10962,Harry Potter,what was that?
10963,Rubeus Hagrid,dragon fire!

10969,Voldemort,avada...
10970,Molly Weasley,harry!
10971,Molly Weasley,hagrid!
10972,Molly Weasley,what happened?!
10973,Molly Weasley,have you seen the others?
10974,Harry Potter,is no one back yet?
10975,Rubeus Hagrid,they were on us from the star' molly -- the death eaters.
10976,Rubeus Hagrid,and you-know-who as well.
10977,Molly Weasley,well thank goodness you two are all right.
10978,Rubeus Hagrid,haven't go' any brandy have yeh molly?
10979,Rubeus Hagrid,fer medicinal purposes?
10980,Ginny Weasley,ron and tonks should've already been back.
10981,Ginny Weasley,dad and fred as well.
10982,Ginny Weasley,oh my god!
10983,Ginny Weasley,george!
10984,Remus Lupin,the house!
10985,Remus Lupin,quickly!
10986,Molly Weasley,my boy!
10987,Molly Weasley,my darling boy!
10988,Molly Weasley,what've they done to you?
10990,Ginny Weasley,remus!
10991,Ginny Weasley,what're you doing!
10992,Remus Lupin,what creature sat in the corner the first time that harry potter visited my office at hogwarts!
10993,Harry Potter,are you mad...?
10994,Remus Lupin,what creature!
10995,Harry Potter,a grindylow!
10996,Remus Lupin,we've been betrayed.
10997,Remus Lupin,voldemort knew you were being moved tonight.
10998,Remus Lupin,i had to make sure you weren't an imposter.
10999,Harry Potter,who did this to him?
11000,Remus Lupin,snape.
11001,Remus Lupin,he'll be fine molly.
11002,Remus Lupin,but that's dark magic.
11003,Remus Lupin,the damage is done.
11004,Rubeus Hagrid,someone else is back.
11005,Kingsley Shacklebolt,the last words albus dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?
11006,Remus Lupin,'harry is the best hope we have.
11007,Remus Lupin,trust him.'
11008,Kingsley Shacklebolt,what gave you away?
11009,Harry Potter,hedwig -- i think.
11010,Harry Potter,she was trying to protect me --
11011,Ron Weasley,hey ya -- well... thanks.
11012,Nymphadora Tonks,deserves that.
11013,Nymphadora Tonks,brilliant he was.
11014,Nymphadora Tonks,wouldn't be standing here without him.
11015,Hermione Granger,really?
11016,Ron Weasley,always the tone of surprise.
11017,Arthur Weasley,are we the last?
11018,Arthur Weasley,where's george?
11019,Arthur Weasley,remus.
11020,Arthur Weasley,where's my son?
11021,Fred Weasley,how do you feel georgie?
11022,George Weasley,saint-like.
11023,Fred Weasley,come again?
11024,George Weasley,saint-like... you see i'm holy.
11025,George Weasley,holey fred geddit?
11026,Fred Weasley,with the whole wide world of ear- related humor at your disposal you go for holey?
11027,Fred Weasley,pathetic.
11028,George Weasley,reckon i'm still better-looking than you.
11029,George Weasley,better-looking than bill that's for sure.
11030,Bill Weasley,mad-eye's dead.
11031,Bill Weasley,mundungus took one look at voldemort and disapparated.
11032,Remus Lupin,mad-eye reckoned you-know-who would expect the real harry to be with the most skilled auror.
11033,Remus Lupin,he knew he'd be in the most danger.
11034,Arthur Weasley,it doesn't explain how they knew we were moving harry tonight.
11035,Rubeus Hagrid,wha'?
11036,Rubeus Hagrid,one of us?
11037,Rubeus Hagrid,tha's mad.
11038,Rubeus Hagrid,i'd wager me life it wasn' none of you lot.
11039,Rubeus Hagrid,an' if it was me i'd kno' wouldn' i?
11040,Rubeus Hagrid,talk in me sleep on occasion i'll admit but there's only fang aroun' ter hear an' mostly it's gibberish an' besides i'd cut me tongue out 'fore 'd betray 'arry e'en in me dreams --
11041,Rubeus Hagrid,wha's so funny!
11042,Harry Potter,i trust you with my life hagrid.
11043,Harry Potter,i trust everyone in this room.
11044,Harry Potter,understood?
11045,Rubeus Hagrid,'ear 'ear.
11046,Remus Lupin,better.
11047,Garrick Ollivander,no!
11048,Garrick Ollivander,no!
11049,Garrick Ollivander,i believed a different wand would work i swear!
11050,Voldemort,then explain this!
11051,Garrick Ollivander,but it makes no sense...
11052,Voldemort,perhaps our friend's loyalties lie elsewhere wormtail.
11053,Garrick Ollivander,no!
11054,Garrick Ollivander,there must be a way!
11055,Garrick Ollivander,i'll think of something else!
11056,Voldemort,i hope so ollivander for your sake.
11057,Voldemort,i won't be so forgiving next time...
11058,Ron Weasley,going somewhere?
11059,Harry Potter,no one else is going to die.
11060,Harry Potter,not for me.
11061,Ron Weasley,for you?
11062,Ron Weasley,you think madeye died for you?
11063,Ron Weasley,you think george took that curse for you?
11064,Ron Weasley,you may be the chosen one mate but this is a whole lot bigger than that.
11065,Harry Potter,come with me.
11066,Harry Potter,now.
11067,Ron Weasley,and leave hermione?
11068,Ron Weasley,are you mad?
11069,Ron Weasley,we wouldn't last two days without her.
11070,Ron Weasley,don't tell her i said that.
11071,Ron Weasley,besides you've still got the trace on you.
11072,Ron Weasley,and there's the wedding...
11073,Harry Potter,wedding?
11074,Ron Weasley,bill and fleur.
11075,Ron Weasley,mum's been planning it for months.
11076,Ron Weasley,only thing that's kept her sane i reckon.
11077,Ron Weasley,she'll kill me if i miss it.
11078,Ron Weasley,kill you too.
11079,Ron Weasley,rather go face to face with you-know-who if i'm honest.
11080,Harry Potter,i don't care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is.
11081,Harry Potter,i have to start searching for the horcruxes.
11082,Harry Potter,it's the only chance we have to beat him.
11083,Harry Potter,and the longer we wait the stronger he gets.
11084,Ron Weasley,tonight's not the night mate.
11085,Ron Weasley,you'd only be doing him a favor.
11086,Ron Weasley,do you think he knows?
11087,Ron Weasley,i mean they're bits of his soul the horcruxes.
11088,Ron Weasley,bits of him.
11089,Ron Weasley,when dumbledore destroyed the ring and you destroyed tom riddle's diary all those years ago -- he must've felt something right?
11090,Ron Weasley,what i'm saying is if we do this thing right if we find the horcruxes and begin to destroy them one by one...
11091,Ron Weasley,won't he know he's being hunted?
11092,Arthur Weasley,all together now!
11093,Arthur Weasley,one.
11094,Arthur Weasley,two.
11095,Arthur Weasley,three!
11096,Ginny Weasley,were you going to tell me?
11097,Harry Potter,yes.
11098,Ginny Weasley,and ron and hermione.
11099,Ginny Weasley,they'll not be going back to hogwarts either?
11100,Ginny Weasley,i see.
11101,Harry Potter,dumbledore didn't want anyone to know what it is we're doing.
11102,Harry Potter,if i tell you i'd be betraying him.
11103,Ginny Weasley,zip me up will you.
11104,Ginny Weasley,seems silly doesn't it?
11105,Ginny Weasley,a wedding.
11106,Ginny Weasley,given everything that's going on.
11107,Harry Potter,maybe that's the best reason to have it.
11108,Harry Potter,because of everything that's going on.
11109,George Weasley,morning.
11110,Arthur Weasley,how's it look on your end boys?
11111,Fred Weasley,brilliant!
11112,George Weasley,bloody hell what's the minister of magic doing here?
11113,Ron Weasley,dunno.
11114,Ron Weasley,but something tells me he didn't come to give away the bride.
11115,Harry Potter,to what do we owe the pleasure minister?
11116,Rufus Scrimgeour,i think we both know the answer to that question mr. potter.
11117,Harry Potter,and this would be...?
11118,Rufus Scrimgeour,don't be coy mr. potter.
11119,Rufus Scrimgeour,mr. weasley.
11120,Rufus Scrimgeour,would you say you were close to your former headmaster?
11121,Ron Weasley,dumbledore?
11122,Ron Weasley,and me?
11123,Ron Weasley,i dunno.
11124,Ron Weasley,i reckon i was just another weasley to him.
11125,Ron Weasley,he was always polite --
11126,Rufus Scrimgeour,and you miss granger?
11127,Rufus Scrimgeour,how would you characterize your relationship?
11128,Hermione Granger,we were friendly not close like harry but --
11129,Harry Potter,what's this all about?
11130,Rufus Scrimgeour,this.
11131,Rufus Scrimgeour,despite the fact that neither of your friends appear to have been particularly close to their recently deceased headmaster he saw fit to remember them in his will.
11132,Rufus Scrimgeour,now why do you suppose that would be?
11133,Harry Potter,no idea.
11134,Rufus Scrimgeour,come now you don't expect me to believe...
11135,Rufus Scrimgeour,'herein is set forth the last will and testament of albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore.
11136,Rufus Scrimgeour,first to ronald bilius weasley i leave my deluminator a device of my own making in the hope that -- when things seem most dark -- it will show him the light.'
11137,Ron Weasley,dumbledore left this?
11138,Ron Weasley,for me?
11139,Ron Weasley,brilliant.
11140,Ron Weasley,er -- what is it?
11141,Ron Weasley,wicked.
11142,Rufus Scrimgeour,'to miss hermione jean granger i leave my copy of the tales of beedle the bard in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.'
11143,Ron Weasley,mum used to read me those!
11144,Ron Weasley,the wizard and the hopping pot babbitty rabbity and her cackling stump...
11145,Ron Weasley,oh c'mon!
11146,Ron Weasley,beedle's stories are famous!
11147,Ron Weasley,babbity rabbitty?
11148,Ron Weasley,no...?
11149,Rufus Scrimgeour,'to harry james potter i leave the snitch he caught in his first quidditch match at hogwarts as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.
11150,Harry Potter,that's it then?
11151,Rufus Scrimgeour,not quite.
11152,Rufus Scrimgeour,dumbledore left you a second bequest:  the sword of godric gryffindor.
11153,Rufus Scrimgeour,unfortunately the sword of gryffindor was not dumbledore's to give away.
11154,Rufus Scrimgeour,as an important historical artifact it belongs...
11155,Hermione Granger,to harry!
11156,Hermione Granger,it belongs to harry!
11157,Hermione Granger,it chose him!
11158,Hermione Granger,it came to him in the chamber of secrets when he most needed it!
11159,Rufus Scrimgeour,the sword may present itself to any worthy gryffindor miss granger.
11160,Rufus Scrimgeour,that does not make it that wizard's property.
11161,Rufus Scrimgeour,and in any event the current whereabouts of the sword are unknown.
11162,Harry Potter,excuse me?
11163,Rufus Scrimgeour,the sword is missing.
11164,Rufus Scrimgeour,i won't pretend to be your friend mr. potter.
11165,Rufus Scrimgeour,but i assure you i'm not your enemy.
11166,Harry Potter,you'll forgive me minister.
11167,Harry Potter,but it's a little hard to tell the difference these days.
11168,Rufus Scrimgeour,dumbledore said something very similar the last time we spoke.
11169,Hermione Granger,where is your guard sir?
11170,Rufus Scrimgeour,i came alone.
11171,Rufus Scrimgeour,i don't really need them anymore...
11172,Remus Lupin,we want you to be the godfather.
11173,Harry Potter,you mean -- but that's brilliant -- i... don't know what to say.
11174,Remus Lupin,say yes.
11175,Luna Lovegood,hello harry!
11176,Luna Lovegood,oh i've interrupted a deep thought haven't i?
11177,Luna Lovegood,i can see it growing smaller in your eyes.
11178,Harry Potter,no 'course not.
11179,Harry Potter,how are you luna?
11180,Luna Lovegood,very well.
11181,Luna Lovegood,i was bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago.
11182,Xenophilius Lovegood,gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!
11183,Xenophilius Lovegood,xenophilius lovegood.
11184,Xenophilius Lovegood,we live just over the hill!
11185,Harry Potter,nice to meet you sir.
11186,Xenophilius Lovegood,i trust you know mr. potter that we at the quibbler unlike those toadies at the daily prophet fully supported dumbledore during his lifetime and in his death support you just as fully.
11187,Luna Lovegood,come daddy.
11188,Luna Lovegood,harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.
11189,Luna Lovegood,he's just too nice to say so.
11190,Harry Potter,sir?
11191,Harry Potter,may i sit down?
11192,Elphias Doge,mr. potter!
11193,Elphias Doge,by all means!
11194,Harry Potter,i found what you wrote in the daily prophet very moving sir.
11195,Harry Potter,i take it you knew professor dumbledore well?
11196,Elphias Doge,i certainly knew him the longest if you don't count his brother aberforth -- and somehow people never do seem to count aberforth.
11197,Harry Potter,i never even knew he had a brother sir.
11198,Elphias Doge,yes well dumbledore was always very private.
11199,Elphias Doge,even as a boy.
11200,Harry Potter,sir i was wondering if you'd had much contact with him before he died.
11201,Elphias Doge,the occasional owl.
11202,Elphias Doge,though it was strange...
11203,Harry Potter,strange sir?
11204,Elphias Doge,it was the owls themselves.
11205,Elphias Doge,they often arrived in distress.
11206,Elphias Doge,it was clear they'd traveled great distances in some cases.
11207,Harry Potter,could you tell me from where they'd come sir?
11208,Elphias Doge,i'm afraid not.
11209,Elphias Doge,albus' messages mostly referenced our days together as schoolboys.
11210,Elphias Doge,they were surprisingly intimate.
11211,Elphias Doge,when he did speak of his current activities his words would turn elliptical.
11212,Elphias Doge,still i sensed he was under great stress.
11213,Elphias Doge,why do you ask?
11214,Harry Potter,just curious.
11215,Harry Potter,i was... close to professor dumbledore.
11216,Elphias Doge,well he treasured you mr. potter i can attest to that.
11217,Elphias Doge,i can also tell you that when a person passes it's only natural to rue the things left unsaid to regret the question never asked.
11218,Elphias Doge,i knew albus nigh on 100 years but in many ways he will always remain a riddle even to me.
11219,Woman,don't despair elphias.
11220,Woman,i'm told he's been thoroughly unriddled by rita skeeter.
11221,Woman,in 800 pages no less.
11222,Elphias Doge,that woman is a vulture muriel and you well know it.
11223,Muriel,someone has to pick the bones to get at the truth.
11224,Muriel,i read your obituary elphias.
11225,Muriel,lovely.
11226,Muriel,but you did skate over some of the sticky patches in dumbledore's life.
11227,Elphias Doge,i'm sorry you think so muriel.
11228,Elphias Doge,i assure you i was writing from the heart.
11229,Muriel,yes well rita skeeter hasn't made that mistake i'm sure.
11230,Muriel,word has it someone talked to her someone who knew the dumbledore family well.
11231,Muriel,you and i both know who that is elphias.
11232,Elphias Doge,a monstrous betrayal.
11233,Elphias Doge,i can only conclude the rumors are true and that she has become untethered.
11234,Harry Potter,who are you talking about?
11235,Muriel,well i don't suppose it'll be a secret once the book comes out.
11236,Muriel,bathilda bagshot.
11237,Harry Potter,who?
11238,Muriel,who?
11239,Muriel,bathilda bagshot!
11240,Muriel,my god boy she's only the most celebrated magical historian of the last century.
11241,Muriel,don't they read history of magic at hogwarts anymore?
11242,Harry Potter,oh right.
11243,Harry Potter,slipped my mind...
11244,Muriel,she knew the dumbledores as well as anyone.
11245,Muriel,she'd have letters perhaps an interesting photograph or two.
11246,Muriel,i'm sure rita skeeter would have thought it well worth a trip to godric's hollow to take a peek into that old bird's rattled cage.
11247,Harry Potter,godric's hollow?
11248,Harry Potter,bathilda bagshot lives in godric's hollow?
11249,Muriel,for years now.
11250,Muriel,that's where she first met dumbledore.
11251,Harry Potter,excuse me?
11252,Harry Potter,you don't mean to say dumbledore lived there too?
11253,Muriel,of course.
11254,Muriel,the family moved there after his father killed those three muggles.
11255,Muriel,it was quite the scandal.
11256,Muriel,honestly my boy are you sure you knew him at all?
11257,Patronus,the ministry has fallen.
11258,Patronus,the minister of magic is dead.
11259,Patronus,they are coming...
11260,Elphias Doge,nice meeting you mr. potter!
11261,Hermione Granger,ron!
11262,Hermione Granger,ron!
11263,Remus Lupin,harry!
11264,Remus Lupin,go!
11265,Remus Lupin,go!
11266,Ron Weasley,where are we?
11267,Hermione Granger,shaftesbury avenue.
11268,Hermione Granger,i used to come here to the theater with my mum and dad.
11269,Hermione Granger,just popped into my head.
11270,Hermione Granger,i don't know why...
11271,Hermione Granger,this way!
11272,Hermione Granger,we need to change.
11273,Ron Weasley,how the ruddy --
11274,Hermione Granger,undetectable extension charm.
11275,Ron Weasley,you're amazing you are.
11276,Hermione Granger,always the tone of surprise.
11277,Hermione Granger,that'll be the books.
11278,Harry Potter,do you reckon everyone's alright at the wedding?
11279,Harry Potter,maybe we should --
11280,Ron Weasley,they were after you mate.
11281,Ron Weasley,we'd just put everyone in danger going back.
11282,Hermione Granger,ron's right.
11283,Hermione Granger,cappuccino please.
11284,Ron Weasley,what she said.
11285,Harry Potter,same.
11286,Woman,wicked scar.
11287,Ron Weasley,so where do we go from here?
11288,Ron Weasley,the leaky cauldron?
11289,Hermione Granger,too dangerous.
11290,Hermione Granger,if voldemort's taken over the ministry none of the old places are safe.
11291,Harry Potter,my rucksack.
11292,Harry Potter,with all my things.
11293,Harry Potter,i left it back at the burrow --
11294,Harry Potter,you're joking.
11295,Hermione Granger,i've had the essentials packed for days.
11296,Hermione Granger,just in case.
11297,Ron Weasley,by the way -- these jeans?
11298,Ron Weasley,not my favorite.
11299,Ron Weasley,bit tight.
11300,Harry Potter,down!
11301,Harry Potter,stupefy!
11302,Hermione Granger,petrificus totalus!
11303,Hermione Granger,go.
11304,Hermione Granger,she doesn't argue.
11305,Harry Potter,lock the door get the lights.
11306,Harry Potter,this one's name is rowle.
11307,Harry Potter,he was on the astronomy tower the night snape killed dumbledore.
11308,Ron Weasley,this is dolohov.
11309,Ron Weasley,i recognize him from the wanted posters.
11310,Ron Weasley,so what do we do with you huh?
11311,Ron Weasley,kill us if it was turned round wouldn't you?
11312,Ron Weasley,suppose it's him that did mad-eye.
11313,Ron Weasley,how would you feel then?
11314,Harry Potter,it's better we wipe their memories.
11315,Harry Potter,we kill them they'll know we were here.
11316,Ron Weasley,you're the boss.
11317,Ron Weasley,hermione?
11318,Ron Weasley,you're the best with spells.
11319,Hermione Granger,obliviate.
11320,Harry Potter,how is it they knew we were there?
11321,Hermione Granger,maybe you still have the trace on you.
11322,Ron Weasley,can't be.
11323,Ron Weasley,the trace breaks at seventeen.
11324,Ron Weasley,it's wizarding law.
11325,Ron Weasley,what?
11326,Hermione Granger,we didn't celebrate your birthday harry.
11327,Hermione Granger,ginny and i -- we'd prepared a cake.
11328,Hermione Granger,we were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding...
11329,Harry Potter,hermione.
11330,Harry Potter,i appreciate the thought -- honestly.
11331,Harry Potter,but given that we were almost killed by a couple of death eaters a few minutes ago...
11332,Hermione Granger,right.
11333,Hermione Granger,perspective.
11334,Ron Weasley,we've got to get off the streets get somewhere safe.
11335,Harry Potter,i have an idea.
11336,Alastor Moody,severus snape?
11337,Harry Potter,mad-eye...?
11338,Ron Weasley,what was that about?
11339,Hermione Granger,mad-eye's doing i'd guess.
11340,Hermione Granger,in case snape decided to come snooping.
11341,Hermione Granger,homenum revelio.
11342,Hermione Granger,it's a spell to reveal human presence.
11343,Hermione Granger,we're alone.
11344,Harry Potter,lumos.
11345,Lily Potter,dear sirius.
11346,Lily Potter,thank you for harry's birthday present.
11347,Lily Potter,you'd think he'd been born on a broom.
11348,Lily Potter,james says he's got the look of a seeker but then james would.
11349,Lily Potter,we had a very quiet birthday tea just us and old bathilda who dotes on harry.
11350,Lily Potter,wormy dropped by late in the day but seemed down and didn't stay long.
11351,Lily Potter,james is frustrated being shut up here but dumbledore's still got his invisibility cloak so he doesn't have much choice.
11352,Lily Potter,by the way bathilda tells the most amazing stories about our old headmaster.
11353,Lily Potter,i don't know how much to believe.
11354,Lily Potter,can it really be true that dumbledore --
11355,Hermione Granger,harry!
11356,Hermione Granger,harry!
11357,Hermione Granger,ron!
11358,Hermione Granger,i've found him!
11359,Ron Weasley,good!
11360,Ron Weasley,tell him from me he's a git!
11361,Hermione Granger,harry you can't just disappear.
11362,Hermione Granger,we thought --
11363,Hermione Granger,it's from your mum.
11364,Hermione Granger,to sirius.
11365,Hermione Granger,bathilda bagshot...?
11366,Harry Potter,yeah.
11367,Harry Potter,they knew her.
11368,Harry Potter,she wrote a history of magic you know.
11369,Hermione Granger,did she now?
11370,Harry Potter,i'm thinking maybe we should go talk to her.
11371,Harry Potter,she still lives in godric's hollow.
11372,Harry Potter,i'm thinking maybe she could help us.
11373,Hermione Granger,harry.
11374,Hermione Granger,i can imagine why you'd want to go there but... i don't think bathilda bagshot is going to know where voldemort hid his horcruxes.
11375,Ron Weasley,hey!
11376,Ron Weasley,i think you two better come down here.
11377,Ron Weasley,the two clinging to the tree are death eaters for sure.
11378,Ron Weasley,dunno 'bout the bloke on the bench.
11379,Ron Weasley,can't see us of course.
11380,Ron Weasley,but we'll have to be careful coming and going.
11381,Ron Weasley,c'mon.
11382,Ron Weasley,there's something else you need to see.
11383,Hermione Granger,lovely.
11384,Harry Potter,to the dark lord.
11385,Harry Potter,i know i will be dead long before you read this... i have stolen the real horcrux and intend to destroy it...
11386,Ron Weasley,r.a.b.
11387,Ron Weasley,was sirius' brother?
11388,Hermione Granger,yes.
11389,Hermione Granger,question is did he actually destroy the real horcrux?
11390,Harry Potter,stop!
11391,Harry Potter,i order you!
11392,Ron Weasley,kreacher...
11393,Harry Potter,been spying on us have you?
11394,Kreacher,kreacher has been... watching.
11395,Kreacher,kreacher always watches.
11396,Hermione Granger,maybe he knows.
11397,Harry Potter,ever seen this before?
11398,Harry Potter,kreacher i own this place.
11399,Harry Potter,sirius left it to me.
11400,Harry Potter,which means i own you too.
11401,Kreacher,that was master regulus' locket.
11402,Harry Potter,that's right.
11403,Harry Potter,but there were two weren't there?
11404,Harry Potter,where's the other one?
11405,Kreacher,kreacher doesn't know where the other locket is.
11406,Hermione Granger,but was it here?
11407,Hermione Granger,did you ever see it?
11408,Kreacher,filthy mudblood -- the death eaters will soon be coming for you!
11409,Kreacher,blood-traitor weasley --
11410,Hermione Granger,ron!
11411,Hermione Granger,ron!
11412,Harry Potter,answer her.
11413,Kreacher,yes.
11414,Kreacher,it was here in this house.
11415,Kreacher,a most evil object...
11416,Harry Potter,how do you mean?
11417,Kreacher,before he died master regulus ordered kreacher to destroy it.
11418,Kreacher,it was the last thing he asked of kreacher.
11419,Kreacher,but no matter how kreacher tried he could not..
11420,Harry Potter,where is it now?
11421,Harry Potter,did someone take it kreacher?
11422,Kreacher,he came in the night.
11423,Kreacher,he took many things including the locket.
11424,Harry Potter,who kreacher?
11425,Harry Potter,who was it?
11426,Kreacher,mundungus.
11427,Kreacher,mundungus fletcher.
11428,Harry Potter,find him.
11429,Pius Thicknesse,as your new minister for magic i promise to restore this temple of tolerance to its former glory.
11430,Pius Thicknesse,therefore beginning today each employee will be required to submit themselves for evaluation.
11431,Pius Thicknesse,but know this:  you have nothing to fear... as long as you have nothing to hide...
11432,Cormac McLaggen,my father will hear about this.
11433,Neville Longbottom,he's not here you fools.
11434,Hermione Granger,they have flesh memories.
11435,Hermione Granger,snitches.
11436,Hermione Granger,they're never touched by bare skin until the seeker captures it.
11437,Hermione Granger,even the wizard who fabricates it wears gloves.
11438,Hermione Granger,that way if there's a dispute the snitch can identify who first touched it.
11439,Harry Potter,you mean... it remembers me?
11440,Hermione Granger,when scrimgeour first gave it to you i thought it might open at your touch -- that dumbledore had hidden something in it.
11441,Dobby,harry potter!
11442,Dobby,so long it's been --
11443,Hermione Granger,expelliarmus!
11444,Kreacher,as requested kreacher has returned with the thief mundungus fletcher!
11445,Dobby,dobby has also returned with the thief mundungus fletcher!
11446,Mundungus Fletcher,what are you playing at -- setting a pair of bleedin' 'ouse-elves on me!
11447,Dobby,dobby was only trying to help!
11448,Dobby,dobby saw kreacher in diagon alley which dobby thought was curious.
11449,Dobby,and then dobby heard kreacher mention harry potter's name which dobby thought was very curious.
11450,Dobby,and then dobby saw that kreacher was talking to the thief mundungus fletcher which dobby thought was very very --
11451,Mundungus Fletcher,i'm no thief you foul little git.
11452,Mundungus Fletcher,i'm a purveyer of rare and wondrous objects --
11453,Ron Weasley,you're a thief dung.
11454,Ron Weasley,everyone knows it.
11455,Dobby,master weasley!
11456,Dobby,so good to see you again!
11457,Ron Weasley,wicked trainers.
11458,Mundungus Fletcher,listen i panicked that night all right?
11459,Mundungus Fletcher,i never volunteered to die for you mate.
11460,Mundungus Fletcher,can i help it if mad-eye fell off his broom --
11461,Hermione Granger,stop lying!
11462,Ron Weasley,piece of advice.
11463,Ron Weasley,let's not rehash old times.
11464,Ron Weasley,got it... mate?
11465,Harry Potter,when you turned this place over -- don't deny it!
11466,Harry Potter,-- you found a locket am i right?
11467,Mundungus Fletcher,why?
11468,Mundungus Fletcher,was it valuable?
11469,Hermione Granger,you've still got it.
11470,Ron Weasley,no.
11471,Ron Weasley,he's worried he should have got more money for it.
11472,Mundungus Fletcher,wouldn't be difficult would it?
11473,Mundungus Fletcher,bleedin' gave it away din' i?
11474,Mundungus Fletcher,there i was pitching me wares in diagon alley when some ministry hag comes up and asks to see my license.
11475,Mundungus Fletcher,says she's of a mind to lock me up and would've too she hadn' taken a fancy to that locket.
11476,Harry Potter,who was she?
11477,Harry Potter,this witch?
11478,Mundungus Fletcher,well she's right there in't she?
11479,Mundungus Fletcher,bleedin' bow an' all.
11480,Ron Weasley,right.
11481,Ron Weasley,so let's do it.
11482,Ron Weasley,who gets who?
11483,Hermione Granger,well unless one of you fancies wearing a skirt...
11484,Hermione Granger,remember what we said.
11485,Hermione Granger,keep your eyes down.
11486,Hermione Granger,don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary.
11487,Hermione Granger,act as normal as possible.
11488,Hermione Granger,just do what you see everyone else doing.
11489,Hermione Granger,we do that -- and with a bit of luck -- we get ourselves inside.
11490,Hermione Granger,and then...
11491,Harry Potter,it gets really tricky.
11492,Hermione Granger,correct.
11493,Harry Potter,this is completely mental.
11494,Hermione Granger,completely utterly without question.
11495,Ron Weasley,the world's mental.
11496,Ron Weasley,come on drink up.
11497,Ron Weasley,we've got a horcrux to find.
11498,Ron Weasley,in case you're interested i'm reg cattermole magical maintenance department.
11499,Hermione Granger,mafalda hopkirk assistant in the improper use of magic office.
11500,Harry Potter,i'm nobody.
11501,Hermione Granger,you're somebody.
11502,Hermione Granger,be careful.
11503,Wizard,morning reg!
11504,Wizard,good luck today.
11505,Ron Weasley,oh... yeah.
11506,Ron Weasley,thanks.
11507,Ron Weasley,what do you reckon he meant by 'good luck.
11508,Ron Weasley,'?
11509,Harry Potter,apparently so.
11510,Ron Weasley,that's bloody disgusting.
11511,Harry Potter,are those...?
11512,Hermione Granger,muggles.
11513,Hermione Granger,in their rightful place.
11514,Wizard,move it will you -- oh runcorn!
11515,Wizard,forgive me...
11516,Hermione Granger,you appear to be quite popular.
11517,Ron Weasley,i gotta tell you i'm starting to freak out a bit.
11518,Harry Potter,the ministry must be hiring young these days.
11519,Ron Weasley,they're not ministry.
11520,Ron Weasley,they're snatchers.
11521,Ron Weasley,they hunt muggle-borns and blood-traitors for a price.
11522,Harry Potter,how long did you say this batch of polyjuice potion would last hermione?
11523,Hermione Granger,i didn't.
11524,Corban Yaxley,cattlemole!
11525,Corban Yaxley,it's still raining in my office.
11526,Corban Yaxley,two days now.
11527,Ron Weasley,really?
11528,Ron Weasley,have you tried an umbrella?
11529,Corban Yaxley,you do realize i'm on my way downstairs don't you cattermole?
11530,Ron Weasley,downstairs...?
11531,Corban Yaxley,to interrogate your wife!
11532,Corban Yaxley,if my wife's blood status were in doubt and the head of the department of magical law enforcement needed a job doing i think i'd make it a priority.
11533,Corban Yaxley,you've got one hour.
11534,Ron Weasley,oh my god.
11535,Ron Weasley,what am i going to do?
11536,Ron Weasley,my wife's all alone downstairs?
11537,Harry Potter,ron.
11538,Harry Potter,you don't have a wife.
11539,Harry Potter,look we'll go with you --
11540,Ron Weasley,no that's mad.
11541,Ron Weasley,you two find umbridge.
11542,Ron Weasley,i'll be fine.
11543,Ron Weasley,but how do i stop it raining?
11544,Hermione Granger,try finite incantatem.
11545,Hermione Granger,of course if something's gone wrong with an atmospheric charm --
11546,Woman,level two.
11547,Woman,department of magical law enforcement including wizengamot administration services auror headquarters and improper use of magic department.
11548,Hermione Granger,this is you.
11549,Ron Weasley,finite incantatem okay.
11550,Ron Weasley,and if that doesn't work...?
11551,Hermione Granger,i don't like him being on his own down there.
11552,Harry Potter,ron's been coming here since he was two years old.
11553,Harry Potter,it's us you should be worrying about.
11554,Hermione Granger,you really have horrible teeth you know that.
11555,Harry Potter,i say if we don't locate umbridge within the hour we go find ron and come back another day.
11556,Harry Potter,deal?
11557,Dolores Umbridge,ah mafalda!
11558,Dolores Umbridge,travers sent you did he?
11559,Dolores Umbridge,good.

11563,Pius Thicknesse,sh...careful.
11564,Dolores Umbridge,runcorn.
11565,Harry Potter,accio locket.
11566,Wizard,all right all right.
11567,Wizard,let's calm down shall we?
11568,Wizard,it probably just snuck up here from experimental charms.
11569,Wizard,i think none of us will soon forget last month's poisonous duck...
11570,Wizard,r-runcorn.
11571,Ron Weasley,m-morning.
11572,Harry Potter,ron it's me.
11573,Ron Weasley,harry!
11574,Ron Weasley,blimey i forgot what you looked like.

11576,Harry Potter,she went down to the courtrooms with umbridge --
11577,Arthur Weasley,i understand wakinda but i can't be a party to that.
11578,Arthur Weasley,hello reg.
11579,Arthur Weasley,isn't mary in for questioning today?
11580,Arthur Weasley,try to have faith.
11581,Arthur Weasley,if there's anything molly and i can do for you --
11582,Wakanda,let me guess.
11583,Wakanda,it's raining in yaxley's office again?
11584,Arthur Weasley,tell him to try an umbrella.
11585,Harry Potter,arthur!
11586,Harry Potter,you know you're being tracked don't you?
11587,Arthur Weasley,is that a threat runcorn?
11588,Harry Potter,no arthur.
11589,Harry Potter,it's a fact.
11590,Harry Potter,they're watching you.
11591,Harry Potter,i'll tell you later.

11612,Mary Cattermole,it chose me.
11613,Dolores Umbridge,no no i don't think so mrs. cattermole.
11614,Dolores Umbridge,wands only choose witches.

11617,Mary Cattermole,tell them reg!

11631,Hermione Granger,we've got to get out of here.

11634,Ron Weasley,get the kids.
11635,Ron Weasley,i'll... i'll meet you there.

11650,Harry Potter,hermione.
11651,Harry Potter,his arm --
11652,Hermione Granger,just do it!
11653,Harry Potter,what happened?
11654,Harry Potter,i thought we were going back to grimmauld place.
11655,Hermione Granger,we were.
11656,Hermione Granger,we were there.
11657,Hermione Granger,but yaxley had hold of me.
11658,Hermione Granger,i knew we couldn't stay once he'd seen so when he let go i brought us here.
11659,Hermione Granger,ron got splinched.
11660,Hermione Granger,i'm... sorry.
11661,Harry Potter,don't be stupid.
11662,Hermione Granger,it's all i feel safe doing.
11663,Hermione Granger,salvio hexia... protego totalum...
11664,Harry Potter,what're you doing?
11665,Hermione Granger,protective enchantments.
11666,Hermione Granger,i don't fancy another visit like we had on shaftesbury avenue do you?
11667,Hermione Granger,especially with ron like this.
11668,Hermione Granger,you can get going on the tent...
11669,Harry Potter,tent?
11670,Harry Potter,where am i supposed to find --
11671,Hermione Granger,repello muggletum... muffliato...
11672,Hermione Granger,how're the mushrooms?
11673,Hermione Granger,seem to be the only edible things growing round here.
11674,Harry Potter,they're great.
11675,Hermione Granger,make sure to leave some for ron.
11676,Harry Potter,no problem.
11677,Harry Potter,how bad is he?
11678,Hermione Granger,he'll be alright in a few days.
11679,Hermione Granger,hopefully.
11680,Hermione Granger,if we could take him to hogwarts to madam pomfrey --
11681,Hermione Granger,so where do we go next?
11682,Harry Potter,dumbledore had a theory.
11683,Harry Potter,he felt that the horcruxes would not be made out of random objects.
11684,Harry Potter,and he felt they wouldn't be hidden randomly either.
11685,Harry Potter,we know of three so far.
11686,Harry Potter,the ring which according to dumbledore belonged to tom riddle's grandfather.
11687,Harry Potter,the diary which belonged to tom himself.
11688,Harry Potter,and this which -- again according to dumbledore -- belonged to his mother.
11689,Hermione Granger,it scares me a bit that thinking it's a piece of vol--
11690,Ron Weasley,no don't!
11691,Ron Weasley,don't say it!
11692,Ron Weasley,it's taboo -- you-know-who's name.
11693,Ron Weasley,that's how they track people now.
11694,Ron Weasley,it's how they found us in the cafe that night.
11695,Harry Potter,how d'you know?
11696,Ron Weasley,i overheard a bloke from the enforcement office talking about it at the ministry.
11697,Ron Weasley,blimey what's that smell?
11698,Hermione Granger,dinner?
11699,Ron Weasley,not bloody likely.
11700,Ron Weasley,smells like something ginny would cook.
11701,Hermione Granger,tea?
11702,Ron Weasley,is that it?
11703,Harry Potter,i know.
11704,Harry Potter,i felt it too.
11705,Harry Potter,it's... it's like it's ticking or something like it has a tiny metal heart like it's --
11706,Ron Weasley,... alive.
11707,Hermione Granger,i hate it.
11708,Hermione Granger,it's like he's here with us.
11709,Harry Potter,that's why we're going to kill it.
11710,Harry Potter,dissendium!
11711,Hermione Granger,incendio!
11712,Harry Potter,expulso!
11713,Hermione Granger,confringo!
11714,Ron Weasley,it's angry.
11715,Hermione Granger,what're you doing?
11716,Harry Potter,we have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it.
11717,Hermione Granger,i can put it in my bag --
11718,Harry Potter,no.
11719,Ron Weasley,seems strange mate.
11720,Ron Weasley,dumbledore sends you off to find a load of horcruxes but doesn't bother to tell you how to destroy them.
11721,Ron Weasley,doesn't that bother you?
11722,Voldemort,you wouldn't be lying to me would you gregorovitch?
11723,Voldemort,because i must tell you... that will only make it worse for you...
11724,Voldemort,who was he?
11725,Voldemort,the thief?
11726,Mykew Gregorovitch,just a boy!
11727,Mykew Gregorovitch,not of the village.
11728,Mykew Gregorovitch,it was he who took it.
11729,Mykew Gregorovitch,i never saw it again.
11730,Mykew Gregorovitch,i swear on my life.
11731,Voldemort,i believe you...
11732,Hermione Granger,i thought it had stopped.
11733,Hermione Granger,you can't let him in harry.
11734,Hermione Granger,dumbledore himself said it.
11735,Hermione Granger,you have to close your mind.
11736,Hermione Granger,it's too dangerous --
11737,Harry Potter,it's not a candle i can blow out hermione.
11738,Harry Potter,it always burns even if it's just a flicker.
11739,Harry Potter,can you understand that?
11740,Hermione Granger,tell me.
11741,Hermione Granger,what you saw.
11742,Harry Potter,he's found him.
11743,Harry Potter,vol--
11744,Harry Potter,you-know-who.
11745,Harry Potter,he's found gregorovitch --
11746,Hermione Granger,the wandmaker?
11747,Harry Potter,yes.
11748,Harry Potter,how'd you know?
11749,Hermione Granger,viktor got his wand from gregorovitch.
11750,Hermione Granger,most durmstrang students did at one time.
11751,Hermione Granger,what's he got to do with you-know-who?
11752,Harry Potter,you-know-who wants something gregorovitch once had -- dunno what.
11753,Harry Potter,but he's desperate to have it.
11754,Harry Potter,it's as if his life depends on it.
11755,Hermione Granger,don't -- it... comforts him.
11756,Harry Potter,well it sets my teeth on edge.
11757,Harry Potter,what's he expecting to hear?
11758,Harry Potter,good news?
11759,Hermione Granger,i think he just hopes he doesn't hear bad news.
11760,Hermione Granger,it gets him through the day.
11761,Harry Potter,and what gets you through the day?
11762,Hermione Granger,we've all made sacrifices harry.
11763,Harry Potter,how long before he can travel?
11764,Hermione Granger,i don't know.
11765,Hermione Granger,it takes time.
11766,Hermione Granger,i'm doing all i can.
11767,Harry Potter,you're not doing enough.
11768,Hermione Granger,take it off.
11769,Hermione Granger,take it off.
11770,Hermione Granger,now.
11771,Hermione Granger,better?
11772,Harry Potter,loads.
11773,Hermione Granger,it's cold.
11774,Hermione Granger,even though it's been lying against your skin for days.
11775,Hermione Granger,we'll take turns.
11776,Hermione Granger,okay?
11777,Scabior,what's that?
11778,Scabior,that... smell?
11779,Harry Potter,snatchers.
11780,Harry Potter,good to know your enchantments work.
11781,Hermione Granger,he could smell it.
11782,Hermione Granger,my perfume.
11783,Harry Potter,we have to leave.
11784,Harry Potter,we're not safe here.
11785,Hermione Granger,i told you.
11786,Hermione Granger,ron's not strong enough to apparate.
11787,Harry Potter,then we'll go by foot.
11788,Ron Weasley,i'm hungry.
11789,Harry Potter,we're all hungry.
11790,Ron Weasley,leave it.
11791,Ron Weasley,mum can make food appear out of thin air.
11792,Hermione Granger,no one can conjure food out of thin air.
11793,Hermione Granger,food is the first of the five principal exceptions to gamp's law.
11794,Hermione Granger,the other four are --
11795,Ron Weasley,oh speak english can't you?
11796,Ron Weasley,i said leave it.
11797,Harry Potter,it'll be dark soon.
11798,Harry Potter,we need to find a place to sleep.
11799,Hermione Granger,good plan.
11800,Ron Weasley,yeah.
11801,Ron Weasley,brilliant.
11802,Ron Weasley,only correct me if i'm wrong... wasn't that yesterday's plan?
11803,Ron Weasley,and the day before that?
11804,Ron Weasley,and the day before that?
11805,Ron Weasley,walk.
11806,Ron Weasley,sleep.
11807,Ron Weasley,walk.
11808,Ron Weasley,sleep.
11809,Harry Potter,my turn.
11810,Ron Weasley,he doesn't know what he's doing does he?
11811,Hermione Granger,none of us do.
11812,Ron Weasley,wizards were here.
11813,Hermione Granger,i don't like this place.
11814,Hermione Granger,i want to go.
11815,Hermione Granger,i'll tell you in a minute.
11816,Harry Potter,maybe you could tell me now.
11817,Hermione Granger,alright.
11818,Hermione Granger,the sword of gryffindor?
11819,Hermione Granger,it's goblin made.
11820,Harry Potter,brilliant.
11821,Hermione Granger,you don't understand.
11822,Hermione Granger,dirt and rust have no effect on the blade.
11823,Hermione Granger,it only takes in that which makes it stronger.
11824,Harry Potter,o-kay.
11825,Hermione Granger,harry.
11826,Hermione Granger,you already destroyed one horcrux right?
11827,Hermione Granger,tom riddle's diary -- in the chamber of secrets.
11828,Harry Potter,with a basilisk fang.
11829,Harry Potter,if you tell me you've got one of those in that bloody beaded bag of yours --
11830,Hermione Granger,don't you see!
11831,Hermione Granger,in the chamber of secrets you stabbed the basilisk with the sword of gryffindor.
11832,Hermione Granger,its blade is impregnated with basilisk venom.
11833,Harry Potter,it only takes in that which makes it stronger...
11834,Hermione Granger,exactly!
11835,Hermione Granger,which means...
11836,Harry Potter,... it can destroy horcruxes.
11837,Hermione Granger,which is why dumbledore left it to you in his will.
11838,Harry Potter,you're brilliant hermione.
11839,Harry Potter,truly.
11840,Hermione Granger,actually i'm highly logical which allows me to look past the extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook.
11841,Harry Potter,there's only one problem...
11842,Ron Weasley,the sword was stolen.
11843,Ron Weasley,yeah i'm still here.
11844,Ron Weasley,but you two carry on.
11845,Ron Weasley,don't let me spoil your fun.
11846,Harry Potter,what's the problem?
11847,Ron Weasley,problem?
11848,Ron Weasley,there's no problem.
11849,Ron Weasley,not according to you anyway.
11850,Harry Potter,look don't be shy.
11851,Harry Potter,if you've got something to say spit it out.
11852,Ron Weasley,all right i'll spit it out.
11853,Ron Weasley,don't expect me to skip up and down because now there's some other damn thing we've got to find.
11854,Hermione Granger,ron...
11855,Harry Potter,i thought you knew what you signed up for.
11856,Ron Weasley,yeah i thought i did too.
11857,Harry Potter,i don't understand.
11858,Harry Potter,what part of this isn't living up to your expectations?
11859,Harry Potter,did you think we'd be staying in five-star hotels?
11860,Harry Potter,finding a horcrux every other day?
11861,Harry Potter,did you think you'd be back to mummy by christmas?
11862,Ron Weasley,no i just reckoned after all this time we'd have actually achieved something.
11863,Ron Weasley,i reckoned you knew what you were doing.
11864,Ron Weasley,i reckoned dumbledore had told you something worthwhile!
11865,Ron Weasley,i reckoned you had a plan!
11866,Harry Potter,i've told you everything dumbledore told me!
11867,Harry Potter,and in case you haven't noticed we've found a horcrux!
11868,Ron Weasley,yeah and we're about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them aren't we!
11869,Hermione Granger,take it off ron.
11870,Hermione Granger,please take it off.
11871,Hermione Granger,you wouldn't be talking like this if you hadn't been wearing it all day --
11872,Harry Potter,yeah he would.
11873,Harry Potter,d'you think i haven't noticed the two of you whispering behind my back?
11874,Harry Potter,d'you think i haven't guessed what you were thinking?
11875,Hermione Granger,harry we weren't --
11876,Ron Weasley,don't lie!
11877,Ron Weasley,you said it too you said you were disappointed --
11878,Hermione Granger,i didn't!
11879,Hermione Granger,not like that!
11880,Hermione Granger,harry -- i didn't!
11881,Ron Weasley,do you know why i listen to that radio every night?
11882,Ron Weasley,do you!
11883,Ron Weasley,to make sure i don't hear ginny's name or fred or george or mum or --
11884,Harry Potter,you think i don't listen!
11885,Harry Potter,you think i don't know what it's like --
11886,Hermione Granger,stop!
11887,Hermione Granger,stop!
11888,Harry Potter,go then.
11889,Harry Potter,but leave that.
11890,Ron Weasley,and you?
11891,Hermione Granger,me?
11892,Ron Weasley,are you staying?
11893,Ron Weasley,or coming?
11894,Ron Weasley,fine.
11895,Ron Weasley,i get it.
11896,Ron Weasley,i saw you two the other night.
11897,Ron Weasley,yeah that's right.
11898,Ron Weasley,didn't know i knew did you?
11899,Hermione Granger,what?
11900,Hermione Granger,ron no -- please --
11901,Hermione Granger,he's gone.
11902,Harry Potter,salvio hexia... protego totalum...
11903,Hermione Granger,it's a muggle station.
11904,Harry Potter,you were right.
11905,Harry Potter,it's like you said.
11906,Harry Potter,snitches have flesh memories.
11907,Harry Potter,but i didn't catch my first snitch with my hand.
11908,Harry Potter,i almost swallowed it.
11909,Hermione Granger,'i open at the close?'
11910,Harry Potter,what do you reckon it means?
11911,Hermione Granger,i don't know.
11912,Hermione Granger,but look i've found something as well...
11913,Hermione Granger,i thought it was a picture of an eye but now i don't think it is.
11914,Hermione Granger,it isn't a rune and it's not in spellman's syllabary either.
11915,Hermione Granger,and it's been inked in -- somebody drew it -- it isn't part of the book.
11916,Harry Potter,luna's dad was wearing that at ron- at bill and fleur's wedding.
11917,Hermione Granger,what d'you mean -- wearing it?
11918,Harry Potter,around his neck.
11919,Harry Potter,like an amulet.
11920,Harry Potter,i didn't think much of it at the time.
11921,Harry Potter,you know luna -- she's always got some mad thing or the other she's carrying around.
11922,Harry Potter,i just figured it ran in the family.
11923,Hermione Granger,why would someone have drawn it in a children's book?
11924,Harry Potter,hermione i've been thinking.
11925,Harry Potter,i -- i want to go to godric's hollow.
11926,Harry Potter,it's where i was born it's where my parents died --
11927,Hermione Granger,and it's exactly where you-know- who will expect you to go.
11928,Hermione Granger,because it means something to you.
11929,Harry Potter,but it means something to him too hermione.
11930,Harry Potter,you-know-who nearly died there.
11931,Harry Potter,wouldn't that be just the kind of place he'd hide a horcrux?
11932,Hermione Granger,it's dangerous harry.
11933,Hermione Granger,but i have to admit recently even i've been thinking we might have to go.
11934,Hermione Granger,i think it's possible something else is hidden there.
11935,Hermione Granger,the sword.
11936,Hermione Granger,if dumbledore didn't want it falling into the ministry's hands but wanted you to find it what better place to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of gryffindor himself?
11937,Harry Potter,godric's hollow is the birthplace of godric gryffindor -- i mean 'course it is.
11938,Harry Potter,obvious isn't it?
11939,Hermione Granger,harry did you ever even open a history of magic?
11940,Harry Potter,tossed it at neville once when he was snoring -- might've popped open.
11941,Harry Potter,hermione...
11942,Hermione Granger,don't ever let me give you a haircut again.
11943,Hermione Granger,i still think we should've used polyjuice potion.
11944,Harry Potter,no.
11945,Harry Potter,this is where i was born.
11946,Harry Potter,i'm not returning as someone else.
11947,Hermione Granger,harry i think it's christmas eve!
11948,Hermione Granger,listen...
11949,Harry Potter,do you think they'd be in there?
11950,Harry Potter,my mum and dad?
11951,Hermione Granger,yeah.
11952,Hermione Granger,i think they would.
11953,Hermione Granger,harry.
11954,Harry Potter,is it -- ?
11955,Hermione Granger,no.
11956,Hermione Granger,but look.
11957,Hermione Granger,did you know he had a sister?
11958,Harry Potter,no.
11959,Hermione Granger,lumos.
11960,Hermione Granger,ignotus... hey har --
11961,Harry Potter,happy christmas hermione.
11962,Hermione Granger,happy christmas harry.
11963,Hermione Granger,harry...
11964,Harry Potter,yeah.
11965,Hermione Granger,someone's watching us.
11966,Hermione Granger,by the gate.
11967,Harry Potter,c'mon.
11968,Hermione Granger,i don't think this is a good idea.
11969,Harry Potter,we look like ordinary muggles.
11970,Hermione Granger,muggles who've just been laying flowers on your parents' grave.
11971,Harry Potter,relax.
11972,Harry Potter,this is right.
11973,Harry Potter,i know it.
11974,Hermione Granger,omigod.
11975,Hermione Granger,harry...
11976,Harry Potter,this is where they died hermione.
11977,Harry Potter,this is where he murdered them.
11978,Harry Potter,you're bathilda aren't you?
11979,Hermione Granger,harry i'm not sure about this.
11980,Harry Potter,hermione she knew dumbledore.
11981,Harry Potter,she might have the sword.
11982,Harry Potter,besides she's barely knee-high to a house-elf.
11983,Harry Potter,i think we can overpower her if it turns ugly.
11984,Hermione Granger,there's something odd about her.
11985,Hermione Granger,and what's that smell?
11986,Harry Potter,she's gaga remember?
11987,Harry Potter,here.
11988,Harry Potter,let me do that.
11989,Hermione Granger,you have a lovely house miss bagshot.
11990,Harry Potter,miss bagshot?
11991,Harry Potter,who is this man?
11992,Harry Potter,his name.
11993,Harry Potter,can you tell me his name?
11994,Harry Potter,this is him hermione.
11995,Harry Potter,the one i saw in gregorovitch's wandshop.
11996,Harry Potter,the thief.
11997,Harry Potter,miss bagshot who is he?
11998,Harry Potter,she wants us to go upstairs.
11999,Hermione Granger,all right...
12000,Harry Potter,she wants me to go.
12001,Harry Potter,alone.
12002,Hermione Granger,why?
12003,Harry Potter,it's all right.
12004,Harry Potter,you stay here.
12005,Hermione Granger,harry...
12006,Harry Potter,lumos.
12007,Bathilda Bagshot,you are potter?
12008,Harry Potter,yes.
12009,Bathilda Bagshot,i have something for you...
12010,Hermione Granger,harry!
12011,Hermione Granger,confringo!
12012,Hermione Granger,harry... harry can you hear me...?
12013,Harry Potter,yes.
12014,Hermione Granger,good.
12015,Hermione Granger,that's good...
12016,Harry Potter,we got away.
12017,Hermione Granger,yes.
12018,Harry Potter,are you alright?
12019,Hermione Granger,i'm fine.
12020,Hermione Granger,but you've been sick.
12021,Hermione Granger,rest... rest a bit more...
12022,Harry Potter,you've outdone yourself this time.
12023,Hermione Granger,the forest of dean.
12024,Hermione Granger,i came here once with my mum and dad years ago.
12025,Hermione Granger,it's just how i remember it.
12026,Hermione Granger,the trees.
12027,Hermione Granger,the river.
12028,Hermione Granger,it's like nothing's changed.
12029,Hermione Granger,not true of course.
12030,Hermione Granger,everything's changed.
12031,Hermione Granger,if i brought my parents here they wouldn't recognize any of it.
12032,Hermione Granger,not the trees.
12033,Hermione Granger,not the river.
12034,Hermione Granger,not... me.
12035,Harry Potter,where are they?
12036,Hermione Granger,wendell and monica wilkens now reside happily in sydney australia.
12037,Hermione Granger,they have two dogs run a small sweet shop but floss daily.
12038,Hermione Granger,no children.
12039,Hermione Granger,maybe we should just stay here harry.
12040,Hermione Granger,grow old.
12041,Hermione Granger,you wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was.
12042,Hermione Granger,well i know.
12043,Hermione Granger,it was in bathilda's sitting room.
12044,Hermione Granger,rita skeeter had sent it to her.
12045,Hermione Granger,harry it doesn't make for very nice reading --
12046,Harry Potter,who is he hermione?
12047,Harry Potter,the thief?
12048,Harry Potter,did dumbledore know him?
12049,Hermione Granger,yes.
12050,Harry Potter,well?
12051,Hermione Granger,for a time.
12052,Harry Potter,tell me hermione.
12053,Harry Potter,who is he?
12054,Hermione Granger,gellert grindelwald.
12055,Hermione Granger,he's not very well known in britain but there was a time before you-know- who...
12056,Harry Potter,hermione i don't need to have read a history of magic to know who gellert grindelwald is.
12057,Hermione Granger,when grindelwald was seventeen he was expelled from durmstrang.
12058,Hermione Granger,he'd started doing some twisted things at school -- experiments.
12059,Hermione Granger,a few teachers had always protected him but they couldn't anymore.
12060,Hermione Granger,after he left he traveled for awhile then ended up in godric's hollow where his great aunt lived bathilda bagshot.
12061,Harry Potter,get to the hard part hermione.
12062,Hermione Granger,she introduced him to dumbledore.
12063,Hermione Granger,it made sense.
12064,Hermione Granger,dumbledore's mother had just died grindelwald was troubled and they were both brilliant -- they'd never really had anyone they could talk to on the same level.
12065,Hermione Granger,they did a lot of talking that summer.
12066,Hermione Granger,but they always returned to one particular subject.
12067,Hermione Granger,wizard rule over muggles.
12068,Harry Potter,and dumbledore believed in it?
12069,Hermione Granger,yes.
12070,Harry Potter,'for the greater good.'
12071,Harry Potter,what does that mean?
12072,Hermione Granger,it was something dumbledore came up with.
12073,Hermione Granger,he believed wizards were superior and should rule over muggles but gently for their own good.
12074,Hermione Granger,grindelwald took a more violent position.
12075,Hermione Granger,it was a different time harry.
12076,Hermione Granger,it was one summer.
12077,Hermione Granger,dumbledore was young --
12078,Harry Potter,we're young hermione.
12079,Harry Potter,and here we are risking our lives to fight against the very thing dumbledore supported.
12080,Hermione Granger,he changed harry.
12081,Hermione Granger,years later it was dumbledore who put grindelwald in prison.
12082,Harry Potter,where's my wand?
12083,Harry Potter,i'll take the watch.
12084,Harry Potter,hermione.
12085,Harry Potter,where's my wand?
12086,Hermione Granger,it's my fault.
12087,Hermione Granger,as we were leaving godric's hollow i cast a curse and it rebounded... i'm sorry harry i tried to mend it but wands are different --
12088,Harry Potter,it's done.
12089,Hermione Granger,maybe we can --
12090,Harry Potter,it's done.
12091,Harry Potter,leave me yours.
12092,Harry Potter,you get back in the warm.
12093,Harry Potter,and give me that.
12094,Hermione Granger,he loved you harry.
12095,Hermione Granger,i know he loved you.
12096,Harry Potter,no...
12097,Harry Potter,lumos!
12098,Harry Potter,accio sword.
12099,Harry Potter,diffindo.
12100,Harry Potter,hermione...
12101,Ron Weasley,are -- you -- mental?
12102,Harry Potter,it was you!
12103,Ron Weasley,well yeah.
12104,Ron Weasley,bit obvious i'd think.
12105,Harry Potter,and the doe.
12106,Harry Potter,that was you as well.
12107,Ron Weasley,no.
12108,Ron Weasley,i reckoned it was you.
12109,Harry Potter,my patronus is a stag.
12110,Ron Weasley,right.
12111,Ron Weasley,antlers.
12112,Harry Potter,you didn't see anyone else?
12113,Ron Weasley,no i... i did think maybe i saw something -- when i was running -- over there --
12114,Ron Weasley,anything?
12115,Harry Potter,but i reckon whoever cast the doe put the sword in that pool hoping we'd find it.
12116,Ron Weasley,and we did didn't we?
12117,Harry Potter,see that?
12118,Harry Potter,it knows.
12119,Harry Potter,it's afraid.
12120,Harry Potter,do it.
12121,Ron Weasley,what?
12122,Ron Weasley,no.
12123,Ron Weasley,harry.
12124,Ron Weasley,that thing's bad for me.
12125,Ron Weasley,i can't handle it.
12126,Ron Weasley,i'm not making excuses for how i acted but that thing affects me more than it affects you and hermione.
12127,Ron Weasley,it made me think stuff -- stuff i was thinking anyway but it made everything worse.
12128,Harry Potter,all the more reason.
12129,Ron Weasley,no.
12130,Ron Weasley,i can't --
12131,Harry Potter,then why are you here?
12132,Harry Potter,why did you come back?
12133,Harry Potter,i'll have to speak to it in order for it to open.
12134,Harry Potter,when it does don't hesitate.
12135,Harry Potter,i don't know what's in here but it'll put up a fight.
12136,Harry Potter,the bit of riddle that was in his diary tried to kill me.
12137,Harry Potter,on three.
12138,Harry Potter,one.
12139,Harry Potter,two.
12140,Harry Potter,three.
12141,Harry Potter,take me inside...
12142,Harry Potter,stab it ron.
12143,Harry Potter,now.
12144,Voldemort,i have seen your heart and it is mine...
12145,Harry Potter,don't listen to it.
12146,Harry Potter,ron.
12147,Harry Potter,don't listen to it!
12148,Harry Potter,ron.
12149,Harry Potter,stab it!
12150,Harry Potter,we were better without you happier without you.
12151,Hermione Granger,who could look at you beside harry potter?
12152,Hermione Granger,what are you compared with the chosen one...?
12153,Harry Potter,ron.
12154,Harry Potter,it lies!
12155,Harry Potter,stab it!
12156,Harry Potter,stab it!
12157,Harry Potter,your mother confessed that she would have preferred me as a son...
12158,Hermione Granger,who wouldn't prefer him what woman would take you you are nothing nothing nothing to him...
12159,Harry Potter,do it ron!
12160,Harry Potter,kill it!
12161,Harry Potter,after you left she cried for a week.
12162,Harry Potter,she's like my sister.
12163,Ron Weasley,i'm sorry.
12164,Ron Weasley,i'm sorry i left.
12165,Harry Potter,you've sort of made up for it tonight.
12166,Harry Potter,getting the sword.
12167,Harry Potter,finishing off the horcrux.
12168,Ron Weasley,saving your life.
12169,Harry Potter,that too.
12170,Ron Weasley,and just think of it.
12171,Ron Weasley,only three to go.
12172,Harry Potter,hermione!
12173,Hermione Granger,everything all right?
12174,Harry Potter,fine.
12175,Harry Potter,actually... more than fine.
12176,Ron Weasley,hey.
12177,Ron Weasley,wo -- hey -- ouch!
12178,Hermione Granger,you -- complete -- arse -- ronald -- weasley!
12179,Hermione Granger,you crawl back here after all these weeks and say 'hey?'
12180,Hermione Granger,where's my wand?
12181,Hermione Granger,harry where's my wand!
12182,Harry Potter,um... i don't know?
12183,Hermione Granger,harry potter you give me my wand!
12184,Ron Weasley,how come he's got your wand?
12185,Hermione Granger,never mind why he's got my wand --
12186,Hermione Granger,what is that?
12187,Hermione Granger,you destroyed it?
12188,Harry Potter,it's a long story.
12189,Hermione Granger,don't think this changes anything.
12190,Ron Weasley,no of course not.
12191,Ron Weasley,i only destroyed a bloody freaking horcrux!
12192,Ron Weasley,why would that change anything!
12193,Ron Weasley,do you know what it was like for me to hear those words coming from you!
12194,Ron Weasley,to see you doing those things --
12195,Hermione Granger,see me doing what things?
12196,Hermione Granger,what happened out there?
12197,Harry Potter,it's a long story.
12198,Ron Weasley,look i wanted to come back the minute i'd left.
12199,Ron Weasley,i just... didn't know how to find you.
12200,Harry Potter,exactly how did you find us?
12201,Ron Weasley,with this.
12202,Ron Weasley,it doesn't just turn off lights.
12203,Ron Weasley,i don't know exactly how it works but christmas morning i -- i was sleeping -- in this little pub-- i'd given some snatchers the slip the night before me being a blood- traitor and all -- anyway i was sleeping when i heard it...
12204,Harry Potter,it?
12205,Ron Weasley,a voice.
12206,Ron Weasley,your voice hermione.
12207,Ron Weasley,coming out of this.
12208,Hermione Granger,and what may i ask did i say?
12209,Ron Weasley,my name.
12210,Ron Weasley,just my name.
12211,Ron Weasley,like a whisper.
12212,Ron Weasley,so i took this and i clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared.
12213,Ron Weasley,and i knew.
12214,Harry Potter,knew what?
12215,Ron Weasley,just knew.
12216,Ron Weasley,on account of hermione's voice.
12217,Ron Weasley,and sure enough it floated toward me the ball of light right to my chest and then -- went straight through -- right here.
12218,Ron Weasley,i could feel it inside me.
12219,Ron Weasley,it was warm like the first sip of a good cup of tea.
12220,Ron Weasley,and i knew it would take me where i needed to go.
12221,Ron Weasley,so i disapparated and came out on this hillside.
12222,Ron Weasley,it was dark.
12223,Ron Weasley,i didn't have any idea where i was.
12224,Ron Weasley,i just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end.
12225,Ron Weasley,and you did.
12226,Ron Weasley,i've always liked it.
12227,Ron Weasley,these flames hermione makes.
12228,Ron Weasley,how long you reckon she'll stay mad at me?
12229,Harry Potter,keep talking 'bout that little ball of light touching your heart -- she'll come round.
12230,Ron Weasley,it was true.
12231,Ron Weasley,every word.
12232,Ron Weasley,bloody hell.
12233,Ron Weasley,i just realized.
12234,Ron Weasley,you need a wand right?
12235,Harry Potter,yeah...
12236,Ron Weasley,well i've got one.
12237,Ron Weasley,here.
12238,Ron Weasley,it's blackthorn ten inches nothing special but i reckon it'll do.
12239,Ron Weasley,i took it off a snatcher a few weeks back.
12240,Ron Weasley,don't tell hermione but they're a bit dim snatchers.
12241,Ron Weasley,this one was definitely part troll.
12242,Ron Weasley,the smell off him...
12243,Harry Potter,engorgio.
12244,Ron Weasley,wo.
12245,Harry Potter,reducio!
12246,Hermione Granger,what's going on in there?
12247,Harry Potter,nothing.
12248,Ron Weasley,nothing.
12249,Ron Weasley,maybe a bit more practice eh?
12250,Hermione Granger,we need to talk.
12251,Ron Weasley,all right.
12252,Hermione Granger,i want to go and see xenophilius lovegood.
12253,Harry Potter,sorry?
12254,Hermione Granger,see this?
12255,Hermione Granger,it's a letter dumbledore wrote to grindelwald.
12256,Hermione Granger,look at the signature.
12257,Hermione Granger,it's the mark again.
12258,Hermione Granger,it keeps cropping up.
12259,Hermione Granger,here.
12260,Hermione Granger,in beedle the bard.
12261,Hermione Granger,in the graveyard in godric's hollow -- what?
12262,Harry Potter,jesus.
12263,Harry Potter,it was there too.
12264,Hermione Granger,where?
12265,Harry Potter,outside gregorovitch's wand shop.
12266,Harry Potter,on the alley wall...
12267,Ron Weasley,but what does it mean?
12268,Hermione Granger,harry you don't have a clue where the next horcrux is.
12269,Hermione Granger,and neither do i.  but this this means something.
12270,Hermione Granger,i'm sure of it.
12271,Ron Weasley,i think hermione's right.
12272,Ron Weasley,i think we ought to go and see lovegood.
12273,Ron Weasley,what say we vote on it?
12274,Ron Weasley,those in favor...
12275,Ron Weasley,sorry harry.
12276,Ron Weasley,looks like it's hermione and me this time.
12277,Harry Potter,not still mad at him are you?
12278,Hermione Granger,i'm always mad at him.
12279,Ron Weasley,luna?
12280,Harry Potter,luna.
12281,Hermione Granger,luna.
12282,Ron Weasley,keep off the dirigible plums.
12283,Xenophilius Lovegood,what is it?
12284,Xenophilius Lovegood,who are you?
12285,Xenophilius Lovegood,what do you want --
12286,Harry Potter,hello mr. lovegood.
12287,Harry Potter,i'm harry potter.
12288,Harry Potter,we met a few months back?
12289,Harry Potter,would it be okay if we came in?
12290,Harry Potter,it won't take long sir.
12291,Harry Potter,i promise.
12292,Xenophilius Lovegood,excuse me.
12293,Xenophilius Lovegood,so.
12294,Xenophilius Lovegood,what brings you here mr. potter?
12295,Harry Potter,well sir we need some help.
12296,Xenophilius Lovegood,ah.
12297,Xenophilius Lovegood,help.
12298,Xenophilius Lovegood,i see.
12299,Xenophilius Lovegood,yes well the thing is helping harry potter rather dangerous these days...
12300,Ron Weasley,aren't you the one who keeps telling everyone it's their first duty to help harry?
12301,Xenophilius Lovegood,i have expressed that view yes.
12302,Xenophilius Lovegood,in the past.
12303,Xenophilius Lovegood,would you excuse me one moment.
12304,Xenophilius Lovegood,i shall return shortly and um try to help you...
12305,Harry Potter,what's going on here?
12306,Ron Weasley,he's mental.
12307,Ron Weasley,let's face it.
12308,Ron Weasley,luna's always good value but she's nutty as squirrel poo.
12309,Hermione Granger,do you see that?
12310,Ron Weasley,well yeah of course.
12311,Ron Weasley,it's massive isn't it?
12312,Hermione Granger,no!
12313,Hermione Granger,don't go near it!
12314,Hermione Granger,it's an erumpent horn.
12315,Hermione Granger,it's a class b tradeable material.
12316,Ron Weasley,yeah all right...
12317,Xenophilius Lovegood,may i offer you all an infusion of gurdyroots?
12318,Xenophilius Lovegood,we make it ourselves.
12319,Hermione Granger,where is luna sir?
12320,Xenophilius Lovegood,luna?
12321,Xenophilius Lovegood,oh um she'll be along.
12322,Xenophilius Lovegood,now how can i help you mr. potter?
12323,Harry Potter,well sir it's about something you were wearing around your neck at the wedding.
12324,Harry Potter,a symbol...
12325,Xenophilius Lovegood,you mean this?
12326,Harry Potter,yes!
12327,Harry Potter,exactly.
12328,Harry Potter,what we wondered sir is well what is it?
12329,Xenophilius Lovegood,what is it?
12330,Xenophilius Lovegood,well it's the sign of the deathly hallows of course.
12331,Harry Potter,the what?
12332,Ron Weasley,the what?
12333,Hermione Granger,the what?
12334,Xenophilius Lovegood,the deathly hallows.
12335,Xenophilius Lovegood,i assume you're all familiar with 'the tale of the three brothers?'
12336,Hermione Granger,yes.
12337,Ron Weasley,yes.
12338,Harry Potter,no.
12339,Hermione Granger,it's in here.
12340,Xenophilius Lovegood,well there's no real reason to go on unless one is familiar with the tale.
12341,Xenophilius Lovegood,why don't you read it aloud miss...?
12342,Hermione Granger,granger.
12343,Hermione Granger,well... all right.
12344,Hermione Granger,there were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely winding road at twilight --
12345,Ron Weasley,midnight.
12346,Ron Weasley,mum always said midnight.
12347,Ron Weasley,but twilight's fine.
12348,Ron Weasley,better actually.
12349,Hermione Granger,in time the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass...
12350,Xenophilius Lovegood,well there you are.
12351,Xenophilius Lovegood,those are the deathly hallows.
12352,Harry Potter,sorry... i still don't really understand...
12353,Xenophilius Lovegood,the elder wand...
12354,Xenophilius Lovegood,the resurrection stone...
12355,Xenophilius Lovegood,... then encloses both in a triangle.
12356,Xenophilius Lovegood,the cloak of invisibility.
12357,Xenophilius Lovegood,together... they make the deathly hallows.
12358,Xenophilius Lovegood,together... they make one master of death.
12359,Hermione Granger,mr. lovegood does the peverell family have anything to do with the deathly hallows?
12360,Xenophilius Lovegood,ignotus and his brothers cadmus and antioch are thought to be the original owners of the hallows and therefore the inspiration for the story.
12361,Xenophilius Lovegood,ah but your tea's grown cold.
12362,Xenophilius Lovegood,excuse me i'll be right back.
12363,Ron Weasley,let's get out of here once he's back.
12364,Ron Weasley,i'm not touching this stuff hot or cold.
12365,Harry Potter,which one would you choose if you could?
12366,Harry Potter,of the deathly hallows?
12367,Hermione Granger,it's obvious isn't it?
12368,Ron Weasley,the wand.
12369,Hermione Granger,the cloak.
12370,Harry Potter,the stone.
12371,Ron Weasley,you're supposed to say the cloak but who wants to spend all day being invisible.
12372,Ron Weasley,dead boring if you ask me.
12373,Ron Weasley,but an unbeatable wand!
12374,Hermione Granger,its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered.
12375,Ron Weasley,yeah but imagine what a short wicked life you'd lead.
12376,Hermione Granger,why the stone harry?
12377,Harry Potter,well you could bring people back couldn't you?
12378,Harry Potter,mad-eye.
12379,Harry Potter,dumbledore.
12380,Harry Potter,sirius.
12381,Harry Potter,anybody.
12382,Hermione Granger,but according to the story they don't want to come back.
12383,Hermione Granger,it's all rubbish anyway.
12384,Hermione Granger,there's no such thing as the deathly hallows.
12385,Harry Potter,but i have one.
12386,Harry Potter,the invisibility cloak my father left me.
12387,Hermione Granger,there have always been cloaks --
12388,Ron Weasley,not like harry's.
12389,Ron Weasley,i've seen a fair few.
12390,Ron Weasley,dad used to bring home the ones the ministry confiscated from petty thieves and the like.
12391,Ron Weasley,they always got holes or tears.
12392,Ron Weasley,harry's is different.
12393,Ron Weasley,it's perfect.
12394,Harry Potter,and i think i've actually held the resurrection stone in my hands that night in dumbledore's office when he showed me the ring he'd destroyed the horcrux.
12395,Harry Potter,it had a symbol on it.
12396,Harry Potter,now i think it was the mark of the hallows.
12397,Hermione Granger,mr. lovegood.
12398,Hermione Granger,thank you sir --
12399,Ron Weasley,you forgot the water.
12400,Xenophilius Lovegood,the water?
12401,Ron Weasley,for the tea.
12402,Xenophilius Lovegood,did didn't i?
12403,Xenophilius Lovegood,how silly of me.
12404,Hermione Granger,no matter sir.
12405,Hermione Granger,we really ought to be go--
12406,Xenophilius Lovegood,no you mustn't --
12407,Harry Potter,sir?
12408,Xenophilius Lovegood,you're my only hope.
12409,Xenophilius Lovegood,they were angry you see about what i'd been writing so they took her.
12410,Xenophilius Lovegood,they took my luna... but it's really you they want...
12411,Harry Potter,who took her sir?
12412,Xenophilius Lovegood,him.
12413,Xenophilius Lovegood,surely you call him you-know- who.
12414,Xenophilius Lovegood,but his real name of course is... voldemort.
12415,Ron Weasley,nooooooooo!
12416,Xenophilius Lovegood,stop!
12417,Xenophilius Lovegood,i've got him --
12418,Hermione Granger,ron!
12419,Hermione Granger,harry!
12420,Hermione Granger,take my hand!
12421,Ron Weasley,that treacherous old bleeder!
12422,Ron Weasley,is there no one we can trust!
12423,Harry Potter,they've kidnapped luna because he supported me.
12424,Harry Potter,he was just desperate.
12425,Ron Weasley,i'll do the enchantments.
12426,Scabior,hello beautiful.
12427,Gellert Grindelwald,ah tom i thought you would come one day.
12428,Gellert Grindelwald,but surely you must know i no longer have what you seek...
12429,Voldemort,if not you then who?
12430,Gellert Grindelwald,you're so innocent tom.
12431,Gellert Grindelwald,like a schoolboy.
12432,Gellert Grindelwald,there's so much you don't understand...
12433,Voldemort,tell me grindelwald.
12434,Voldemort,tell me where to find it!
12435,Voldemort,tell me who possesses it!
12436,Voldemort,the name grindelwald!
12437,Voldemort,the name!
12438,Gellert Grindelwald,can't you guess tom?
12439,Gellert Grindelwald,it lies with him of course.
12440,Gellert Grindelwald,buried within the earth.
12441,Gellert Grindelwald,it is he who possesses it even in death.
12442,Gellert Grindelwald,your old friend and mine... dumbledore.
12443,Harry Potter,they exist.
12444,Harry Potter,the hallows.
12445,Harry Potter,but he only wants the one the last one.
12446,Harry Potter,that's what he's been looking for.
12447,Hermione Granger,what're you saying?
12448,Harry Potter,he knows where it is you-know- who.
12449,Harry Potter,he'll have it by the end of the night.
12450,Harry Potter,he's found the elder wand.
12451,Ron Weasley,don't touch her!
12452,Hermione Granger,stop it!
12453,Scabior,your boyfriend'll get worse than that if he doesn't behave lovely.
12454,Scabior,what happened to you ugly?
12455,Scabior,what's your name?
12456,Harry Potter,dudely.
12457,Harry Potter,vernon dudley.

12459,Scabior,and you ginger?
12460,Ron Weasley,stan shunpike.

12462,Scabior,we know skinny stan.
12463,Scabior,try again.
12464,Ron Weasley,weasley... barney weasley.
12465,Scabior,weasley eh?
12466,Scabior,wouldn't be related to that blood traitor arthur weasley would you?
12467,Ron Weasley,piss off!
12468,Ron Weasley,arthur weasley's ten times the wizard you are!
12469,Scabior,worth ten times you if i can find him.
12470,Scabior,wasn't you that tipped him off was it?
12471,Scabior,how 'bout you lovely?
12472,Scabior,what do they call you...?
12473,Hermione Granger,penelope clearwater.
12474,Hermione Granger,half-blood.
12475,Scabior,you smell like vanilla penelope.
12476,Scabior,i think you're going to be my favorite.
12477,Snatcher,there's no vernon dudley on 'ere.
12478,Fenrir Greyback,hear that ugly?
12479,Fenrir Greyback,the list says you're lying.
12480,Fenrir Greyback,how come you don't want us to know who you are?
12481,Fenrir Greyback,hm?
12482,Harry Potter,the list is wrong.
12483,Harry Potter,i told you who i am --
12484,Scabior,change of plans boys.
12485,Scabior,we won't be taking this lot to the ministry.
12486,Harry Potter,what did you put on me?
12487,Hermione Granger,a stinging jinx.
12488,Harry Potter,how long will it last?
12489,Hermione Granger,not long.
12490,Bellatrix Lestrange,show me.
12491,Bellatrix Lestrange,get draco.
12492,Bellatrix Lestrange,well?
12493,Draco Malfoy,i can't be sure.
12494,Lucius Malfoy,draco.
12495,Lucius Malfoy,look closely son.
12496,Lucius Malfoy,if we are the ones to hand potter over to the dark lord... ...everything would be forgiven.
12497,Lucius Malfoy,all would be as it was you understand?
12498,Scabior,now we won't be forgetting who actually caught him i hope mr. malfoy.
12499,Lucius Malfoy,you dare to talk to me like that in my own house?
12500,Bellatrix Lestrange,lucius.
12501,Bellatrix Lestrange,don't be shy sweetie.
12502,Bellatrix Lestrange,come over.
12503,Bellatrix Lestrange,now if this isn't who we think it is draco and we call him he'll kill us all.
12504,Bellatrix Lestrange,we need to be absolutely sure.
12505,Draco Malfoy,what's wrong with his face?
12506,Bellatrix Lestrange,yes what is wrong with his face?
12507,Snatcher,he came to us like that.
12508,Snatcher,something he picked up in the forest i reckon.
12509,Bellatrix Lestrange,or ran into a stinging jinx.
12510,Bellatrix Lestrange,was it you dearie?
12511,Bellatrix Lestrange,give me her wand.
12512,Bellatrix Lestrange,we'll see what her last spell was.
12513,Bellatrix Lestrange,ah.
12514,Bellatrix Lestrange,got you.
12515,Bellatrix Lestrange,what is that?
12516,Bellatrix Lestrange,where'd you get that from?
12517,Snatcher,it was in her bag when we searched her.
12518,Snatcher,reckon it's mine now.
12519,Snatcher,are you mad?
12520,Snatcher,go!
12521,Snatcher,get out!
12522,Bellatrix Lestrange,cissy put the boys in the cellar.
12523,Bellatrix Lestrange,i want to have a little conversation with this one girl-to-girl.
12524,Ron Weasley,what are we gonna do?
12525,Ron Weasley,we can't leave hermione alone with her.
12526,Luna Lovegood,ron?
12527,Luna Lovegood,harry?
12528,Harry Potter,luna?
12529,Bellatrix Lestrange,that sword is meant to be in my vault at gringotts.
12530,Bellatrix Lestrange,how did you get it?
12531,Bellatrix Lestrange,what else did you and your friends take from my vault?
12533,Hermione Granger,i didn't take anything.
12534,Hermione Granger,please.
12535,Hermione Granger,i didn't take anything.
12536,Bellatrix Lestrange,i don't believe it.
12537,Ron Weasley,we have to do something.
12538,Garrick Ollivander,there's no way out of here.
12539,Garrick Ollivander,we've tried everything.
12540,Garrick Ollivander,it's enchanted.
12541,Hermione Granger,please!
12542,Hermione Granger,please!
12543,Bellatrix Lestrange,shut up!
12544,Luna Lovegood,you're bleeding harry.
12545,Luna Lovegood,that's a curious thing to keep in your sock.
12546,Harry Potter,help us.
12547,Ron Weasley,let her go.
12548,Peter Pettigrew,shut up.
12549,Peter Pettigrew,get back.
12550,Peter Pettigrew,you goblin come with me.
12551,Dobby,aah!
12552,Harry Potter,dobby?
12553,Harry Potter,what are you doing here?
12554,Dobby,dobby has come to rescue harry potter of course.
12555,Dobby,dobby will always be there for harry potter.
12556,Harry Potter,you can apparate in and out of this room?
12557,Harry Potter,could you take us with you?
12558,Dobby,of course sir.
12559,Dobby,i'm an elf.
12560,Ron Weasley,works for me.
12561,Harry Potter,dobby i want you to take luna and mr. ollivander--
12562,Ron Weasley,shell cottage on the outskirts of tinworth.
12563,Ron Weasley,trust me.
12564,Luna Lovegood,whenever you're ready sir.
12565,Dobby,sir?
12566,Dobby,i like her very much.
12567,Dobby,meet me at the top of the stairs in 10 seconds.
12568,Peter Pettigrew,ow.
12569,Dobby,who gets his wand?
12570,Bellatrix Lestrange,i'm only going to ask you once more goblin.
12571,Bellatrix Lestrange,think very very carefully before you answer.
12572,Griphook,i don't know.
12573,Bellatrix Lestrange,you don't know?
12574,Bellatrix Lestrange,why weren't you doing your job?
12575,Bellatrix Lestrange,who got into my vault?
12576,Bellatrix Lestrange,who stole it?
12577,Bellatrix Lestrange,who stole it?
12578,Bellatrix Lestrange,well?
12579,Griphook,when i was last in your vault the sword was there.
12580,Griphook,oh well then perhaps it just walked out on its own then.
12581,Griphook,there is no place safer than gringotts.
12582,Bellatrix Lestrange,liar!
12583,Bellatrix Lestrange,consider yourself lucky goblin.
12584,Bellatrix Lestrange,the same won't be said for this one.
12585,Ron Weasley,like hell.
12586,Ron Weasley,expellliarmus!
12587,Harry Potter,stupefy.
12588,Bellatrix Lestrange,stop!
12589,Bellatrix Lestrange,drop your wands.
12590,Bellatrix Lestrange,i said drop them!
12591,Bellatrix Lestrange,pick them up draco now.
12592,Bellatrix Lestrange,well well well look what we have here.
12593,Bellatrix Lestrange,it's harry potter.
12594,Bellatrix Lestrange,he's all bright and shiny and new again just in time for the dark lord.
12595,Bellatrix Lestrange,call him.
12596,Bellatrix Lestrange,call him.
12597,Harry Potter,stupefy!
12598,Bellatrix Lestrange,stupid elf.
12599,Bellatrix Lestrange,you could've killed me.
12600,Dobby,dobby never meant to kill.
12601,Dobby,dobby only meant to maim or seriously injure.
12602,Bellatrix Lestrange,how dare you take a witch's wand?
12603,Bellatrix Lestrange,how dare you defy your masters?
12604,Dobby,dobby has no master.
12605,Dobby,dobby is a free elf.
12606,Dobby,and dobby has come to save harry potter and his friends.
12607,Harry Potter,hermione.
12608,Harry Potter,you're all right.
12609,Harry Potter,we're safe.
12610,Harry Potter,we're all safe.
12611,Dobby,harry potter.
12612,Harry Potter,dobby.
12613,Harry Potter,dobby.
12614,Harry Potter,no just-- hold on.
12615,Harry Potter,hold on.
12616,Harry Potter,look just hold on okay?
12617,Harry Potter,we'll fix you.
12618,Harry Potter,hermione will have something.
12619,Harry Potter,in your bag.
12620,Harry Potter,hermione?
12621,Harry Potter,hermione?
12622,Harry Potter,what is it?
12623,Harry Potter,help me.
12624,Dobby,such a beautiful place... ...to be with friends.
12625,Dobby,dobby is happy to be with his friend... ...harry potter.
12626,Luna Lovegood,we should close his eyes.
12627,Luna Lovegood,don't you think?
12628,Luna Lovegood,there.
12629,Luna Lovegood,now he could be sleeping.
12630,Harry Potter,i want to bury him.
12631,Harry Potter,properly.
12632,Harry Potter,without magic.
12633,Luna Lovegood,it's beautiful here.
12634,Bill Weasley,it was our aunt's.
12635,Bill Weasley,we used to come here as kids.
12636,Bill Weasley,the order uses it now as a safe house -- what's left of us at least.
12637,Luna Lovegood,muggles think these keep evil away.
12638,Luna Lovegood,but they're wrong...
12639,Harry Potter,i need to talk to the goblin.
12640,Harry Potter,how are you?
12641,Griphook,alive.
12642,Harry Potter,you probably don't remember --
12643,Harry Potter,yes.
12644,Griphook,and brought me here.
12645,Griphook,you are a very unusual wizard.
12646,Harry Potter,why did you leave gringotts?
12647,Griphook,soon the death eaters will control it.
12648,Griphook,that was unacceptable to me.
12649,Ron Weasley,then you're on our side.
12650,Griphook,this is a wizard's war.
12651,Griphook,i take no side.
12652,Griphook,it is impossible.
12653,Harry Potter,alone yes.
12654,Harry Potter,with you no.
12655,Griphook,how did you come by this sword?
12656,Harry Potter,it's complicated.
12657,Harry Potter,why did bellatrix lestrange think it should be in her vault at gringotts?
12658,Griphook,it's complicated.
12659,Harry Potter,the sword presented itself to us in a moment of need.
12660,Harry Potter,we didn't steal it.
12661,Griphook,there is a sword in madam lestrange's vault identical to this one but it is a fake.
12662,Griphook,it was placed there this past summer.
12663,Harry Potter,and she never suspected?
12664,Griphook,the replica is very convincing.
12665,Griphook,only a goblin would recognize that this is the true sword of gryffindor.
12666,Ron Weasley,who put it there?
12667,Ron Weasley,the fake.
12668,Griphook,it was not my place to ask nor did i desire to.
12669,Griphook,there are more than a few curious things in the vaults at gringotts.
12670,Harry Potter,and in madam lestrange's vault as well?
12671,Griphook,perhaps.
12672,Griphook,i have no interest in gold.
12673,Harry Potter,then what?
12674,Harry Potter,the goblin twists the curl at his chin... then his eyes
12675,Griphook,that is my price.
12676,Griphook,i have your word harry potter that you will give me the sword of gryffindor if i help you?
12677,Hermione Granger,harry are you thinking there's a horcrux in bellatrix's vault?
12678,Harry Potter,she was terrified when she thought we'd been in there.
12679,Harry Potter,she kept asking you what else we'd taken.
12680,Harry Potter,i'd bet anything there's a horcrux there.
12681,Harry Potter,if we find it we can kill it.
12682,Harry Potter,and if we kill it we're one step closer to killing him.
12683,Ron Weasley,and if we find one?
12684,Ron Weasley,how're we supposed to destroy it if we've given griphook the sword?
12685,Harry Potter,i'm still working on that part.
12686,Fleur Delacour,he's too weak.
12687,Garrick Ollivander,forgive me if i don't get up.
12688,Harry Potter,mr. ollivander i need to ask you a few questions.
12689,Garrick Ollivander,anything m'boy anything.
12690,Harry Potter,can you identify these sir?
12691,Garrick Ollivander,walnut and dragon heartstring.
12692,Garrick Ollivander,twelve and three quarter inches.
12693,Garrick Ollivander,unyielding.
12694,Garrick Ollivander,this belongs to bellatrix lestrange.
12695,Harry Potter,and this?
12696,Garrick Ollivander,hawthorn.
12697,Garrick Ollivander,unicorn hair.
12698,Garrick Ollivander,ten inches.
12699,Garrick Ollivander,reasonably pliant.
12700,Garrick Ollivander,this was the wand of draco malfoy.
12701,Harry Potter,was?
12702,Harry Potter,isn't it still?
12703,Garrick Ollivander,perhaps not -- if you won it from him.
12704,Garrick Ollivander,i sense its allegiance has changed.
12705,Garrick Ollivander,the wand chooses the wizard mr. potter.
12706,Garrick Ollivander,that much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.
12707,Harry Potter,what do you know about the deathly hallows sir?
12708,Garrick Ollivander,there are rumored to be three: the elder wand the resurrection stone and the invisibility cloak.
12709,Garrick Ollivander,it is said that to possess them all is to make oneself the master of death.
12710,Garrick Ollivander,but few truly believe such objects exist --
12711,Harry Potter,but you sir?
12712,Harry Potter,do you believe they exist?
12713,Harry Potter,you're lying.
12714,Harry Potter,you know one exists and you told him about it.
12715,Harry Potter,you told him about the elder wand and where to go looking for it.
12716,Garrick Ollivander,he tortured me!
12717,Garrick Ollivander,besides i conveyed only rumors.
12718,Garrick Ollivander,there's no guarantee he will find it --
12719,Harry Potter,he has found it sir.
12720,Harry Potter,that's all sir.
12721,Harry Potter,we'll leave you to get some rest now.
12722,Garrick Ollivander,he's after you mr. potter.
12723,Garrick Ollivander,if it's true what you say that he has the elder wand i'm afraid you really don't stand a chance.
12724,Harry Potter,then i guess i'll just have to kill him before he finds me sir.
12725,Ron Weasley,you're sure it's hers?
12726,Hermione Granger,positive.
12727,Hermione Granger,harry turns to the two wands on the table -- the ones he showed ollivander -- and extends the longest to hermione.
12728,Harry Potter,i reckon you should take this then.
12729,Ron Weasley,you heard ollivander.
12730,Ron Weasley,it's harry's now.
12731,Hermione Granger,but i hate that thing -- that's the wand that killed sirius!
12732,Hermione Granger,how can i hold it and not feel...
12733,Harry Potter,if i can hold it you can.
12734,Ron Weasley,how will we know what it is when we get in there?
12735,Ron Weasley,after all a horcrux can be anything.
12736,Harry Potter,i'll know.
12737,Harry Potter,i can't explain.
12738,Harry Potter,it's like...
12739,Ron Weasley,that's a bit scary.
12740,Hermione Granger,it is harry.
12741,Hermione Granger,did dumbledore ever say anything to you something that might explain why --
12742,Harry Potter,no.
12743,Harry Potter,i just know.
12744,Harry Potter,when one's near.
12745,Fleur Delacour,this is the closest i could find to what you described hermione.
12746,Hermione Granger,it's perfect.
12747,Hermione Granger,thank you fleur.
12748,Bill Weasley,you're leaving aren't you.
12749,Harry Potter,in the morning.
12750,Bill Weasley,and griphook?
12751,Harry Potter,he'll be leaving too.
12752,Bill Weasley,listen i don't know what you're up to but i know goblins.
12753,Bill Weasley,if you've struck any kind of bargain with griphook you must be exceptionally careful to live up to it.
12754,Bill Weasley,if you don't... he won't be forgiving.
12755,Luna Lovegood,the sky has lost a star.
12756,Luna Lovegood,my father used to say that when a child died.
12757,Luna Lovegood,she looks up smiles.
12758,Harry Potter,yeah.
12759,Harry Potter,funny.
12760,Harry Potter,listen luna about your father i don't want you to think i --
12761,Luna Lovegood,i know you understand why my father did what he did harry.
12762,Luna Lovegood,that's why we don't need to talk about it.
12763,Harry Potter,hogwarts?
12764,Harry Potter,it's not the place you left you
12765,Luna Lovegood,neither am i.
12766,Ron Weasley,always good value.
12767,Ron Weasley,i'll miss her.
12768,Ron Weasley,what d'you think?
12769,Harry Potter,wouldn't know you if i didn't know you.
12770,Ron Weasley,you want to tell me what that is?
12771,Harry Potter,sirius gave it to me.
12772,Harry Potter,he had a matching piece.
12773,Harry Potter,he said if i ever needed him all i had to do was look into it.
12774,Ron Weasley,you mean he could see you?
12775,Harry Potter,something like that.
12776,Harry Potter,i don't know.
12777,Harry Potter,he died before i ever got to use it.
12778,Harry Potter,the thing is...
12779,Ron Weasley,go on.
12780,Harry Potter,you'll think i'm mental but more than once when i've looked into it -- i think i've seen dumbledore.
12781,Ron Weasley,bloody hell... that's a sight.
12782,Bellatrix Lestrange,well how do i look?
12783,Ron Weasley,hideous.
12784,Bellatrix Lestrange,oh dear i missed a spot didn't i?
12785,Bellatrix Lestrange,hold still...
12786,Ron Weasley,couldn't do anything about that bit in the back that's always flipping up could you?
12787,Ron Weasley,dead annoying --
12788,Ron Weasley,never mind.
12789,Ron Weasley,i'm good.
12790,Ron Weasley,that is you in there isn't it?
12791,Harry Potter,you can give that to hermione to hold all right griphook?
12792,Goblin,madam lestrange.
12793,Griphook,good morning?
12794,Griphook,good morning?
12795,Griphook,you're bellatrix lestrange not some dewy-eyed schoolgirl!
12796,Ron Weasley,hey.
12797,Ron Weasley,easy.
12798,Griphook,she gives us away and we might as well use that sword to slit our own throats.
12799,Griphook,understand?
12800,Hermione Granger,he's right.
12801,Hermione Granger,i was being stupid.
12802,Harry Potter,c'mon.
12803,Harry Potter,let's do it.
12804,Goblin,identification.
12805,Bellatrix Lestrange,i wish to enter my vault.
12806,Goblin,i see.
12807,Goblin,very well.
12808,Goblin,excuse me won't you?
12809,Bellatrix Lestrange,i don't like to be kept waiting.
12810,Goblin,next.
12811,Bellatrix Lestrange,he's with me.
12812,Griphook,they know!
12813,Ron Weasley,what do you mean?
12814,Griphook,they know she's an imposter!
12815,Griphook,they've been warned!
12816,Bogrod,madam lestrange.
12817,Bogrod,would you mind presenting your wand?
12818,Bellatrix Lestrange,and why should i do that?
12819,Ron Weasley,harry what do we do?
12820,Ron Weasley,harry...?
12821,Bogrod,it's the bank's policy.
12822,Bogrod,i'm sure you understand given the current climate --
12823,Bellatrix Lestrange,no i most certainly do not understand --
12824,Bogrod,i'm afraid i must insist.
12825,Harry Potter,imperio.
12826,Bogrod,very well madam lestrange.
12827,Bogrod,if you will follow me.
12828,Goblin,but... bogrod there have been special instructions regarding the lestrange vault.
12829,Bogrod,i'm fully aware of that.
12830,Bogrod,i'm also aware the lestranges are one of our oldest and most respected families.
12831,Goblin,yes sir but our instructions are very specific --
12832,Bogrod,let me be specific with you ricbert.
12833,Bogrod,i've run this bank for forty-five years long before anyone had even heard of a death eater.
12834,Bogrod,the day may come that they feel they can run this place better than me but that day has not yet arrived.
12835,Bogrod,am i understood!
12836,Bogrod,madam if you will i will escort you myself.
12837,Harry Potter,how long before they come after us?
12838,Ron Weasley,what's that?
12839,Ron Weasley,up ahead.
12840,Griphook,i should have known --
12841,Harry Potter,what is that griphook?
12842,Harry Potter,griphook!
12843,Harry Potter,what is that!
12844,Harry Potter,well done.
12845,Harry Potter,hey.
12846,Griphook,the thief's downfall.
12847,Griphook,washes away all enchantments.
12848,Griphook,can be deadly.
12849,Ron Weasley,you don't say.
12850,Ron Weasley,just out of interest... is there any other way out of here?
12851,Griphook,no.
12852,Bogrod,what the devil are you all doing down here!
12853,Griphook,we need him!
12854,Bogrod,is this your doing griphook?
12855,Bogrod,you have no rights here anymore.
12856,Bogrod,when you gave up your keys you --
12857,Ron Weasley,imperio!
12858,Griphook,well done.
12859,Ron Weasley,no.
12860,Ron Weasley,it's not possible...
12861,Ron Weasley,bloody hell.
12862,Ron Weasley,that's a welsh green.
12863,Hermione Granger,it looks like it's been down here forever.
12864,Griphook,go on.
12865,Ron Weasley,it's been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.
12866,Hermione Granger,that's barbaric.
12867,Hermione Granger,i...
12868,Griphook,we'll only have a few seconds.
12869,Griphook,in other words... they'll be no do-
12870,Griphook,ready bogrod?
12871,Bogrod,hm?
12872,Bogrod,oh.
12873,Bogrod,yes.
12874,Bogrod,of course.
12875,Harry Potter,lumos !
12876,Ron Weasley,lumos !
12877,Hermione Granger,lumos !
12878,Ron Weasley,blimey...
12879,Hermione Granger,look.
12880,Hermione Granger,no wonder bellatrix thought it was real.
12881,Ron Weasley,is it here harry?
12882,Ron Weasley,can you feel anything?
12883,Hermione Granger,it's hot!
12884,Hermione Granger,all eyes turn to the bowl wobbling madly on the floor when... it splits apart and begins to multiply.
12885,Hermione Granger,ron your foot!
12886,Griphook,we'll be crushed!
12887,Griphook,hurry!
12888,Harry Potter,that's it.
12889,Harry Potter,up there.
12890,Hermione Granger,how're we going to reach it?
12891,Harry Potter,give me the sword!
12892,Harry Potter,the real one.
12893,Ron Weasley,keep going!
12894,Hermione Granger,harry!
12895,Hermione Granger,behind you!
12896,Ron Weasley,the cup!
12897,Hermione Granger,in here!
12898,Harry Potter,we have a deal griphook.
12899,Griphook,i said i'd get you in.
12900,Griphook,i never said anything about getting you out.
12901,Harry Potter,griphook!
12902,Harry Potter,griphook!
12903,Griphook,thieves!
12904,Griphook,help!
12905,Griphook,thieves!
12906,Ron Weasley,foul little git.
12907,Ron Weasley,least we've got bogrod.
12908,Ron Weasley,that's unfortunate.
12909,Hermione Granger,we can't just stand here!
12910,Hermione Granger,who's got an idea?
12911,Ron Weasley,you're asking us?
12912,Ron Weasley,you're the brilliant one.
12913,Hermione Granger,i've got something.
12914,Hermione Granger,but it's mad.
12915,Hermione Granger,relashio!
12916,Ron Weasley,that's your idea?
12917,Harry Potter,come on!
12918,Hermione Granger,it doesn't realize it's free!
12919,Ron Weasley,that was brilliant!
12920,Ron Weasley,brilliant!
12921,Ron Weasley,bloody hell.
12922,Harry Potter,we're dropping!
12923,Ron Weasley,i say we jump!
12924,Hermione Granger,when?
12925,Voldemort,the boy has discovered our secret nagini.
12926,Voldemort,we must find out just how much he knows.
12927,Voldemort,we must return to our hiding places and see if the others are safe.
12928,Harry Potter,he knows.
12929,Hermione Granger,how is it you --
12930,Harry Potter,i saw him.
12931,Hermione Granger,you let him in!
12932,Hermione Granger,harry you can't --
12933,Harry Potter,i can't always help it hermione!
12934,Ron Weasley,never mind!
12935,Ron Weasley,what did you see?
12936,Harry Potter,he's angry.
12937,Harry Potter,but he's scared too.
12938,Harry Potter,he's going to make sure the other horcruxes are safe.
12939,Ron Weasley,what happens when he finds out four are gone?
12940,Harry Potter,i reckon he'll do anything to stop us from finding the rest.
12941,Harry Potter,there's more: one of them's at hogwarts.
12942,Hermione Granger,what?
12943,Ron Weasley,what?
12944,Hermione Granger,you saw it?
12945,Hermione Granger,tonight?
12946,Hermione Granger,but we have to plan.
12947,Hermione Granger,we have to figure out what --
12948,Harry Potter,honestly hermione when have any of our plans actually worked?
12949,Harry Potter,we plan we get there and all hell breaks loose.
12950,Ron Weasley,'fraid he's right.
12951,Ron Weasley,one problem: snape's headmaster now.
12952,Ron Weasley,we can't just walk in the front door.
12953,Harry Potter,we'll go to hogsmeade.
12954,Harry Potter,to honeydukes.
12955,Harry Potter,take the secret passage in the cellar.
12956,Harry Potter,there's something wrong with him.
12957,Harry Potter,in the past i could always follow his thoughts.
12958,Harry Potter,now everything feels disconnected.
12959,Ron Weasley,maybe it's because of the horcruxes.
12960,Ron Weasley,maybe he's growing weaker.
12961,Ron Weasley,maybe he's dying.
12962,Harry Potter,no.
12963,Harry Potter,it's more like he's wounded.
12964,Harry Potter,if anything he feels more
12965,Hermione Granger,they were ready for us.
12966,Death Eater,we know you're here potter.
12967,Death Eater,there's no getting away.
12968,Death Eater,perhaps you need some convincing.
12969,Ron Weasley,what's he mean by that?
12970,Hermione Granger,no you'll give us away.
12971,Harry Potter,expecto patronum!
12972,Aberforth Dumbledore,in here potter.
12973,Ron Weasley,did you get a look at him!
12974,Ron Weasley,fora second i thought it was --
12975,Hermione Granger,i know.
12976,Hermione Granger,harry!
12977,Hermione Granger,i can see you!
12978,Hermione Granger,in here!
12979,Aberforth Dumbledore,you bloody fools!
12980,Aberforth Dumbledore,what were you thinking coming here?
12981,Aberforth Dumbledore,do you have any idea how dangerous it is --
12982,Harry Potter,you're aberforth.
12983,Harry Potter,dumbledore's brother.
12984,Harry Potter,it's you i've been seeing -- here.
12985,Harry Potter,it's
12986,Aberforth Dumbledore,where've you left him?
12987,Harry Potter,he's dead.
12988,Aberforth Dumbledore,sorry to hear it.
12989,Aberforth Dumbledore,i liked that elf.
12990,Aberforth Dumbledore,mundungus fletcher 'bout a year ago.
12991,Harry Potter,dung had no right selling you that.
12992,Harry Potter,it belonged to --
12993,Aberforth Dumbledore,sirius.
12994,Aberforth Dumbledore,albus told me.
12995,Aberforth Dumbledore,he also told me that you'd likely be hacked off if you ever found out i had it.
12996,Aberforth Dumbledore,but ask yourself where you'd be if i didn't.
12997,Aberforth Dumbledore,right then.
12998,Aberforth Dumbledore,reckon you're hungry.
12999,Aberforth Dumbledore,let's get you fed then think of the best way to get you out of here.
13000,Hermione Granger,do you hear much from the others?
13001,Hermione Granger,from the order?
13002,Aberforth Dumbledore,the order is finished.
13003,Aberforth Dumbledore,you-know- who's won.
13004,Aberforth Dumbledore,anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves.
13005,Harry Potter,we need to get into hogwarts.
13006,Harry Potter,dumbledore gave us a job to do.
13007,Aberforth Dumbledore,did he now?
13008,Aberforth Dumbledore,nice job?
13009,Aberforth Dumbledore,easy?
13010,Harry Potter,we've been hunting horcruxes.
13011,Harry Potter,we think the last one's in the school.
13012,Harry Potter,but we'll need your help getting in.
13013,Harry Potter,if we can find it and kill it then we kill him and then we can end this war once and for all.
13014,Harry Potter,we need to get into hogwarts tonight.
13015,Aberforth Dumbledore,it's not a job my brother's given you it's a suicide mission.
13016,Aberforth Dumbledore,do yourself a favor boy.
13017,Aberforth Dumbledore,go home.
13018,Aberforth Dumbledore,live a little longer.
13019,Harry Potter,dumbledore trusted me to see this through.
13020,Harry Potter,why should he...
13021,Aberforth Dumbledore,keep secrets?
13022,Aberforth Dumbledore,you tell me.
13023,Harry Potter,i only care about the dumbledore i knew.
13024,Harry Potter,i trusted him.
13025,Aberforth Dumbledore,did you now?
13026,Aberforth Dumbledore,and why is that?
13027,Harry Potter,i had no reason not to —-
13028,Aberforth Dumbledore,that's a boy's answer.
13029,Aberforth Dumbledore,a boy who goes chasing horcruxes on the word of a man who won't even tell him where to start.
13030,Aberforth Dumbledore,you're lying.
13031,Aberforth Dumbledore,not just to me which doesn't matter but to yourself as well.
13032,Aberforth Dumbledore,that's what a fool does.
13033,Harry Potter,you're drunk.
13034,Aberforth Dumbledore,you don't strike me as a fool mr. potter.
13035,Aberforth Dumbledore,so i'll ask you again.
13036,Aberforth Dumbledore,there must be a reason.
13037,Aberforth Dumbledore,why do you trust anything my brother ever said to you?
13038,Aberforth Dumbledore,why?
13039,Aberforth Dumbledore,you know what to do...
13040,Harry Potter,where've you sent her?
13041,Aberforth Dumbledore,you'll see soon enough.
13042,Hermione Granger,that's ariana isn't it?
13043,Hermione Granger,your sister.
13044,Hermione Granger,she's beautiful.
13045,Aberforth Dumbledore,she'll always be beautiful.
13046,Hermione Granger,she died very young didn't she.
13047,Aberforth Dumbledore,my brother sacrificed many things mr. potter in his journey to find power including her.
13048,Aberforth Dumbledore,she was devoted to him -- he gave her everything but time.
13049,Hermione Granger,mr. dumbledore... thank you.
13050,Hermione Granger,did save our lives twice.
13051,Hermione Granger,kept an eye on us in that mirror.
13052,Hermione Granger,that doesn't seem like someone who's given up does it?
13053,Hermione Granger,she's coming back!
13054,Hermione Granger,and she's got someone with her!
13055,Ron Weasley,who's that with her?
13056,Ron Weasley,bloody hell...
13057,Neville Longbottom,i knew you'd come!
13058,Neville Longbottom,i told them alii!
13059,Neville Longbottom,harry potter would never abandon hogwarts!
13060,Harry Potter,neville you look...
13061,Neville Longbottom,like hell?
13062,Neville Longbottom,i reckon.
13063,Neville Longbottom,this is nothing.
13064,Neville Longbottom,seamus is worse.
13065,Neville Longbottom,you'll see.
13066,Neville Longbottom,hermione!
13067,Neville Longbottom,ron!
13068,Neville Longbottom,hey ab.
13069,Neville Longbottom,there might be a couple more people on the way.
13070,Neville Longbottom,well?
13071,Neville Longbottom,ready?
13072,Ron Weasley,i don't remember this being on the marauder's map.
13073,Neville Longbottom,that's because it never existed till now.
13074,Neville Longbottom,the seven secret passages were sealed off before the start of the year.
13075,Neville Longbottom,this is the only way in or out now.
13076,Neville Longbottom,the grounds are crawling with death eaters and dementors.
13077,Hermione Granger,how bad is it neville?
13078,Hermione Granger,with snape as headmaster.
13079,Neville Longbottom,hardly ever see him.
13080,Neville Longbottom,it's the carrows you have to watch out for.
13081,Harry Potter,the carrows?
13082,Neville Longbottom,brother and sister.
13083,Neville Longbottom,they're in charge of discipline.
13084,Neville Longbottom,like punishment the carrows.
13085,Hermione Granger,they did that to you?
13086,Hermione Granger,but why?
13087,Neville Longbottom,today's dark arts lesson had us practicing the cruciatus curse.
13088,Neville Longbottom,on first years.
13089,Neville Longbottom,i refused.
13090,Neville Longbottom,hogwarts has changed.
13091,Neville Longbottom,aw c'mon.
13092,Neville Longbottom,don't be grim.
13093,Neville Longbottom,we're all used to it by now.
13094,Neville Longbottom,and the thing is it helps when people stand up gives everyone hope.
13095,Neville Longbottom,i used to notice that when you did it harry.
13096,Neville Longbottom,c'mon we're almost there.
13097,Neville Longbottom,let's have a bit of fun shall we?
13098,Neville Longbottom,hey!
13099,Neville Longbottom,listen up you lot!
13100,Neville Longbottom,i've brought you a surprise!
13101,Seamus Finnigan,blimey.
13102,Neville Longbottom,get the word out to remus and the others that harry's back.
13103,Nigel Wolpert,river da calling.
13104,Nigel Wolpert,do you read?
13105,Nigel Wolpert,we have a new weather report: lightning has struck.
13106,Nigel Wolpert,i repeat lightning has struck...
13107,Neville Longbottom,okay okay!
13108,Neville Longbottom,stand down!
13109,Neville Longbottom,llet's not kill them before you-know-who gets the chance!
13110,Harry Potter,okay.
13111,Harry Potter,there's something we need to find something hidden here in the castle.
13112,Harry Potter,it could help us defeat you-know-who.
13113,Neville Longbottom,what is it?
13114,Harry Potter,we don't know.
13115,Dean Thomas,where is it?
13116,Harry Potter,i realize it's not much to go on.
13117,Seamus Finnigan,that's nothing to go on.
13118,Harry Potter,i think it might have something to do with ravenclaw.
13119,Harry Potter,it would be small easy to conceal valuable.
13120,Harry Potter,any ideas?
13121,Luna Lovegood,well there's rowena ravenclaw's lost diadem.
13122,Luna Lovegood,the lost diadem of ravenclaw?
13123,Luna Lovegood,hasn't anyone ever heard of it?
13124,Luna Lovegood,it's quite famous.
13125,Cho Chang,yes but luna it's lost.
13126,Cho Chang,for centuries now.
13127,Cho Chang,there's not a person alive today who's seen it.
13128,Ron Weasley,excuse me.
13129,Ron Weasley,but would someone tell me: what's a bloody diadem?
13130,Cho Chang,it's a kind of crown.
13131,Cho Chang,you know like a tiara.
13132,Cho Chang,ravenclaw's was rumored to have magical properties to enhance the wisdom of the wearer.
13133,Ginny Weasley,harry.
13134,Harry Potter,hey there.
13135,Harry Potter,ron smiles about to speak then notices ginny's eyes have not left harry.
13136,Harry Potter,he frowns speaks to hermione.
13137,Ron Weasley,six months she hasn't seen me and it's like i'm frankie first year.
13138,Ron Weasley,i mean i'm only her brother.
13139,Seamus Finnigan,got loads of those though doesn't she?
13140,Seamus Finnigan,there's only one harry.
13141,Ron Weasley,shut up seamus.
13142,Neville Longbottom,what is it ginny?
13143,Ginny Weasley,snape knows.
13144,Ginny Weasley,he knows that harry was spotted in hogsmeade.
13145,Alecto Carrow,put a smile on miss reynolds.
13146,Alecto Carrow,wouldn't want me to have to pay a visit to daddy again would you?
13147,Severus Snape,many of you are surely wondering why i have summoned you here at this hour.
13148,Severus Snape,it has come to my attention that earlier this evening... harry potter was sighted in hogsmeade.
13149,Severus Snape,i mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by
13150,Severus Snape,for myself and a few select members of the staff this comes as little surprise.
13151,Severus Snape,we have for some time considered mr. potter's return to hogwarts to be not only possible but inevitable.
13152,Severus Snape,consequently in the past several months and under my specific direction exhaustive defensive strategies have been employed to defeat any attempt mr. potter might make to breach these walls.
13153,Severus Snape,but know this.
13154,Severus Snape,should anyone -- student or staff -- attempt to aid mr. potter that person will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression.
13155,Severus Snape,rest assured: so long as i am headmaster at hogwarts harry potter will never again step foot in this castle.
13156,Severus Snape,now then.
13157,Severus Snape,if anyone here has knowledge of mr. potter's movements this evening... i invite them to step forward now.
13158,Harry Potter,i think i can help you out with that... -.. harry appears.
13159,Harry Potter,and i'm afraid it's rather extensive.
13160,Harry Potter,how dare you stand where he stood.
13161,Harry Potter,tell them how it was that night.
13162,Harry Potter,tell then how you looked him in the eye a man who trusted you... and killed him.
13163,Harry Potter,tell them!
13164,Harry Potter,i'm a gryffindor.
13165,Voldemort,i know that many of you will want to fight.
13166,Voldemort,some of you may even think this wise.
13167,Voldemort,but this is foily.
13168,Voldemort,i wish you no harm.
13169,Voldemort,ti have great respect for the students of hogwarts.
13170,Voldemort,i was once one myself after all.
13171,Voldemort,i ask for but one thing and if granted no magical blood shail be spiit...
13172,Voldemort,give me harry potter.
13173,Voldemort,do this and none shall be harmed.
13174,Voldemort,give me harry potter and i shail leave hogwarts untouched.
13175,Voldemort,give me harry potter and you will be rewarded.
13176,Pansy Parkinson,but he's there!
13177,Pansy Parkinson,potter's there!
13178,Pansy Parkinson,someone grab him!
13179,Argus Filch,students out of bed!
13180,Argus Filch,students in the corridors!
13181,Argus Filch,oh.
13182,Argus Filch,sorry mum.
13183,Argus Filch,right away.
13184,Harry Potter,time.
13185,Harry Potter,as much as you can give me.
13186,Harry Potter,is that possible professor?
13187,Harry Potter,i think you're right.
13188,Harry Potter,you too professor.
13189,Neville Longbottom,let me get this straight professor.
13190,Neville Longbottom,you're giving us permission to do this?
13191,Neville Longbottom,to blow it up.
13192,Neville Longbottom,boom.
13193,Neville Longbottom,wicked.
13194,Seamus Finnigan,i can bring 'er down.
13195,Filius Flitwick,you realize of course that nothing we do will be able to keep out you-know-who indefinitely.
13196,Pomona Sprout,that doesn't mean we can't hold him up.
13197,Professors,protego maxima... finato duri... repello inimicum...
13198,Ron Weasley,harry hermione and i have been thinking.
13199,Ron Weasley,it doesn't really matter if we find the horcrux.
13200,Hermione Granger,unless we can destroy it.
13201,Ron Weasley,so we were thinking --
13202,Hermione Granger,you were thinking.
13203,Hermione Granger,it's ron's idea.
13204,Hermione Granger,and it's brilliant.
13205,Ron Weasley,you destroyed tom riddle's diary with a basilisk fang right?
13206,Ron Weasley,well we know where we might find one don't we?
13207,Harry Potter,okay.
13208,Harry Potter,but take this.
13209,Harry Potter,that way you can find me when you get back.
13210,Hermione Granger,where are you going?
13211,Harry Potter,ravenclaw common room.
13212,Harry Potter,got to start somewhere.
13213,Harry Potter,hermione nods slips the map in her beaded bag and she and ron head off.
13214,Harry Potter,just before they turn the corner ron looks back holds harry's glance briefly... and then is
13215,Luna Lovegood,harry!
13216,Luna Lovegood,wait!
13217,Luna Lovegood,i need to talk to
13218,Harry Potter,i'm a bit preoccupied right now luna.
13219,Harry Potter,we'll talk later luna.
13220,Luna Lovegood,harry --
13221,Harry Potter,later.
13222,Luna Lovegood,don't you remember what cho said about rowena ravenclaw's diadem: 'there's not a person alive who's seen it.'
13223,Luna Lovegood,it's obvious isn't it?
13224,Luna Lovegood,we have to talk to someone who's dead.
13225,Luna Lovegood,he's very impressive isn't he?
13226,Voldemort,they never learn.
13227,Voldemort,such a pity.
13228,Voldemort,begin.
13229,Pius Thicknesse,but my lord shouldn't we wait --
13230,Fred Weasley,nice night for it!
13231,Harry Potter,okay luna.
13232,Harry Potter,who've you got in mind?
13233,Seamus Finnigan,that's it.
13234,Seamus Finnigan,i want a charge on each and every joist.
13235,Neville Longbottom,you do know what you're doing don't you seamus?
13236,Neville Longbottom,blimey.
13237,Neville Longbottom,not good.
13238,Luna Lovegood,if you're to find her you'll find her down there.
13239,Luna Lovegood,no.
13240,Luna Lovegood,i think it best if you two talk alone.
13241,Luna Lovegood,she's very shy.
13242,Kingsley Shacklebolt,tell professor mcgonagall remus and i will handle this side of the castle.
13243,Dean Thomas,yes sir.
13244,Kingsley Shacklebolt,dean!
13245,Remus Lupin,it's the quality of one's conviction that determines success not the number of one's followers.
13246,Kingsley Shacklebolt,who said that?
13247,Remus Lupin,me.
13248,Remus Lupin,speaking of quality.
13249,Remus Lupin,you shouldn't have.
13250,Remus Lupin,it's teddy who needs you.
13251,Nymphadora Tonks,he'll sleep 'til dawn and snore like his father.
13252,Nymphadora Tonks,it's you who needs me tonight.
13253,Harry Potter,it's you...
13254,Neville Longbottom,ha!

13263,Hermione Granger,no.
13264,Hermione Granger,of course not.
13265,Ron Weasley,i've never got this far before.
13266,Hermione Granger,i'm scared.
13267,Ron Weasley,me too.
13268,Ron Weasley,hermione: i didn't expect it to be like this.
13269,Hermione Granger,not this.
13270,Harry Potter,you're the grey lady the ghost of ravenclaw tower.
13271,Helena Ravenclaw,i do not answer to that name.
13272,Harry Potter,i'm sorry.
13273,Harry Potter,it's helena isn't it?
13274,Harry Potter,helena ravenclaw.
13275,Harry Potter,rowena's daughter.
13276,Harry Potter,luna told me.
13277,Helena Ravenclaw,are you a friend of luna's?
13278,Harry Potter,yes.

13288,Helena Ravenclaw,many have sought my mother's diadem.

13293,Harry Potter,you have to believe me!
13294,Harry Potter,i want to destroy it.
13295,Harry Potter,that's what you want isn't it helena?
13296,Harry Potter,you want it destroyed.

13299,Harry Potter,i'll end your pain helena.
13300,Harry Potter,tell me where it is and i'll destroy it i swear on my mother's memory —-

13303,Helena Ravenclaw,but he lied.
13304,Harry Potter,he's lied to many people --
13305,Helena Ravenclaw,i know what he's done!
13306,Helena Ravenclaw,i know who he is!
13307,Helena Ravenclaw,he defiled it!

13325,Seamus Finnigan,he's good...
13326,Ginny Weasley,what?
13327,Neville Longbottom,that was kind of exciting.
13328,Neville Longbottom,seamus grins and winks knowingly.
13329,Neville Longbottom,ginny shakes her head.
13330,Ginny Weasley,mad.
13331,Ginny Weasley,the both of you.

13338,Neville Longbottom,never better!
13339,Neville Longbottom,feel like i could spit fire!
13340,Neville Longbottom,haven't seen luna have you?
13341,Harry Potter,luna -- ?
13342,Neville Longbottom,i'm mad for her!
13343,Neville Longbottom,think it's about time i told her seeing as there's a pretty good chance we'll both be dead by dawn!
13344,Ginny Weasley,i know.
13345,Ron Weasley,bloody hell.
13346,Ron Weasley,we/'ll never find him on this.
13347,Hermione Granger,there he is.
13348,Ron Weasley,brilliant.
13349,Hermione Granger,he vanished.
13350,Hermione Granger,just now.
13351,Hermione Granger,i saw it.
13352,Hermione Granger,ron glances at map -- then:
13353,Hermione Granger,that's right.
13354,Hermione Granger,i did.
13355,Ron Weasley,let's go.
13356,Hermione Granger,brilliant.
13357,Draco Malfoy,take my hand.
13358,Draco Malfoy,well well what brings you here potter?
13359,Draco Malfoy,harry looks slowly over his shoulder.
13360,Draco Malfoy,draco -- blaise and goyle at his side -- steps into view his face bisected by light.
13361,Draco Malfoy,he holds a wand on harry.
13362,Harry Potter,i could ask you the same.
13363,Draco Malfoy,i virtually lived here last year.
13364,Draco Malfoy,remember?
13365,Harry Potter,i remember.
13366,Harry Potter,what's wrong with the one you have?
13367,Draco Malfoy,easy.
13368,Harry Potter,why didn't you tell her?
13369,Harry Potter,bellatrix.
13370,Harry Potter,you knew it was me.
13371,Harry Potter,but you didn't say anything.
13372,Draco Malfoy,give me my wand.
13373,Harry Potter,no.
13374,Harry Potter,i don't think so...
13375,Harry Potter,besides its allegiance is to me now.
13376,Harry Potter,if you want it you'll have to win it back.
13377,Harry Potter,perhaps even kill me...
13378,Gregory Goyle,c'mon draco.
13379,Gregory Goyle,don't be a prat.
13380,Gregory Goyle,avada kedavra!
13381,Harry Potter,expelliarmus!
13382,Hermione Granger,did you see where it went?
13383,Hermione Granger,the diadem!
13384,Harry Potter,well done.
13385,Harry Potter,let's find ron and get out of here.
13386,Ron Weasley,run!
13387,Ron Weasley,goyle's set the bioody place on fire!
13388,Harry Potter,split up!
13389,Hermione Granger,do we climb!
13390,Harry Potter,no it''ll just follow us!
13391,Harry Potter,here!
13392,Harry Potter,take one!
13393,Ron Weasley,serves him right.
13394,Hermione Granger,c'mon!
13395,Hermione Granger,this way!
13396,Harry Potter,wait!
13397,Harry Potter,what about malfoy and blaise!
13398,Ron Weasley,brilliant.
13399,Voldemort,nagini.
13400,Voldemort,come.
13401,Ron Weasley,you're bloody well welcome!
13402,Harry Potter,ron you once asked me if i thought he felt it -- voldemort -- when we destroy a horcrux when we destroy a piece of his soul.
13403,Harry Potter,he does.
13404,Harry Potter,it's the snake.
13405,Harry Potter,she's the last one.
13406,Harry Potter,the last horcrux.
13407,Ron Weasley,where will he take her?
13408,Hermione Granger,someplace safe.
13409,Harry Potter,no.
13410,Harry Potter,he'll keep her close.
13411,Ron Weasley,look inside him harry.
13412,Ron Weasley,find out where he is.
13413,Ron Weasley,if we find him we find the snake.
13414,Ron Weasley,then we're one step closer to ending this.
13415,Voldemort,stop looking at her.
13416,Voldemort,she smells your fear.
13417,Voldemort,it agitates her.
13418,Voldemort,be grateful she's just eaten.
13419,Lucius Malfoy,forgive me my lord but wouldn't it be more prudent to call off this battle and seek the boy yourself?
13420,Voldemort,i do not need to seek the boy!
13421,Voldemort,before the night is out he will come to me!
13422,Voldemort,do you understand!
13423,Lucius Malfoy,of c-course my lord.
13424,Voldemort,how do you live with yourself lucius?
13425,Voldemort,go.
13426,Voldemort,find severus.
13427,Voldemort,tell him i need to see him immediately.
13428,Harry Potter,i know where he is.
13429,Sybill Trelawney,there's more to me than incense and tea leaves mr. finnegan.
13430,Luna Lovegood,thanks.
13431,Neville Longbottom,don't mention it.
13432,Voldemort,why doesn't it work for me?
13433,Severus Snape,you have performed extraordinary magic with this wand my lord.
13434,Severus Snape,in the last few hours alone --
13435,Voldemort,no!
13436,Voldemort,i am extraordinary!
13437,Voldemort,but the wand resists me!
13438,Severus Snape,there is no wand more powerful.
13439,Severus Snape,ollivander himself said it.
13440,Severus Snape,tonight when the boy comes to you it will not fail you i am sure.
13441,Severus Snape,it answers to you and you only.
13442,Voldemort,does it?
13443,Severus Snape,my lord?
13444,Voldemort,the wand.
13445,Voldemort,does it truly answer to me?
13446,Voldemort,you're a clever man severus.
13447,Voldemort,surely you must know.
13448,Voldemort,where severus?
13449,Voldemort,where does its loyalty lie?
13450,Severus Snape,with you of course my lord.
13451,Voldemort,the elder wand cannot serve me properly severus because i am
13452,Voldemort,the elder wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner.
13453,Voldemort,ollivander was quite explicit about that.
13454,Voldemort,you killed dumbledore severus.
13455,Voldemort,while you live the elder wand cannot be truly mine.
13456,Severus Snape,my lord --
13457,Voldemort,you have been a good and faithful servant severus.
13458,Voldemort,but only i can live forever...
13459,Voldemort,kill.
13460,Voldemort,nagini!
13461,Voldemort,come!
13462,Severus Snape,take them...
13463,Severus Snape,take them!
13464,Severus Snape,please.
13465,Harry Potter,give me something!
13466,Harry Potter,quickly!
13467,Harry Potter,a flask!
13468,Harry Potter,anything.
13469,Severus Snape,they are the same...
13470,Severus Snape,you have your mother's eyes...
13471,Ron Weasley,he's gone.
13472,Ron Weasley,the snake too.
13473,Voldemort,you have fought valiantly... but in vain.
13474,Voldemort,i do not wish this.
13475,Voldemort,every drop of magical bliood
13476,Voldemort,i therefore command my forces to retreat.
13477,Voldemort,in their absence dispose of your dead with dignity.
13478,Voldemort,treat your injured.
13479,Ron Weasley,never!
13480,Ron Weasley,do you hear me!
13481,Ron Weasley,never!
13482,Hermione Granger,where is everyone?
13483,Severus Snape,lily... then...
13484,Petunia Dursley,lily!
13485,Petunia Dursley,come out of there!
13486,Petunia Dursley,now!
13487,Petunia Dursley,we're going home.
13488,Severus Snape,she's jealous.
13489,Severus Snape,because she's ordinary and you're special.
13490,Lily Potter,that's mean.
13491,Severus Snape,it's true.
13492,Severus Snape,you know so yourself.
13493,Severus Snape,no!
13494,Severus Snape,don't kill me!
13495,Albus Dumbledore,that wasn't my intention.
13496,Albus Dumbledore,stand up severus.
13497,Albus Dumbledore,i haven't much time.
13498,Albus Dumbledore,what message do you bring from lord voldemort this time?
13499,Albus Dumbledore,is this about the prophecy?
13500,Severus Snape,yes.
13501,Albus Dumbledore,how much did you relay?
13502,Severus Snape,only what i heard.
13503,Severus Snape,but now... he thinks it refers to her.
13504,Albus Dumbledore,the prophecy did not refer to a woman.
13505,Albus Dumbledore,it spoke of a boy born at the end of july --
13506,Severus Snape,yes!
13507,Severus Snape,but he thinks it's her son!
13508,Severus Snape,he intends to hunt them down now!
13509,Severus Snape,to kill them!
13510,Albus Dumbledore,if she means so much to you surely lord voldemort would spare her in exchange for the boy.
13511,Severus Snape,i have asked.
13512,Albus Dumbledore,you disgust me.
13513,Albus Dumbledore,you would sacrifice the life of an innocent child over a schoolboy crush?
13514,Severus Snape,she's more than that!
13515,Severus Snape,she's different!
13516,Severus Snape,beautiful.
13517,Severus Snape,kind.
13518,Albus Dumbledore,and should i do so what will you give me in return severus?
13519,Severus Snape,anything.
13520,Severus Snape,you said you would keep her safe!
13521,Albus Dumbledore,lily and james put their faith in the wrong person.
13522,Albus Dumbledore,rather like you severus.
13523,Albus Dumbledore,the boy survives.
13524,Albus Dumbledore,he has her eyes.
13525,Severus Snape,he doesn't need protection.
13526,Severus Snape,the dark lord has gone --
13527,Albus Dumbledore,the dark lord will return.
13528,Albus Dumbledore,and the boy will be in terrible danger when he does.
13529,Severus Snape,no one can know.
13530,Severus Snape,your word.
13531,Albus Dumbledore,my word that i shall never reveal the best of you severus?
13532,Albus Dumbledore,if you insist.
13533,Severus Snape,he exhibits no measurable talent.
13534,Severus Snape,his arrogance rivals even his father's.
13535,Severus Snape,and he seems to relish his fame.
13536,Albus Dumbledore,sometimes we see what we expect to see severus.
13537,Albus Dumbledore,other teachers indicate the boy is modest likeable and while no prodigy possesses above-average gifts.
13538,Albus Dumbledore,personally i find him rather engaging.
13539,Severus Snape,you see what you want to see.
13540,Albus Dumbledore,perhaps.
13541,Albus Dumbledore,ooh.
13542,Albus Dumbledore,severus.
13543,Severus Snape,why did you put it on?
13544,Severus Snape,surely you realized it carried a curse.
13545,Albus Dumbledore,i was... foolish... greedy...
13546,Severus Snape,drink the rest.
13547,Severus Snape,it will contain the curse to the hand for the time being.
13548,Albus Dumbledore,for the time being?
13549,Severus Snape,it will spread.
13550,Albus Dumbledore,how long?
13551,Severus Snape,maybe a year.
13552,Albus Dumbledore,well this makes matters much more straightforward.
13553,Albus Dumbledore,do not ignore me severus.
13554,Albus Dumbledore,was it not you who told me of lord voldemort's plan to have the malfoy boy murder me?
13555,Severus Snape,it is not expected that he will succeed.
13556,Albus Dumbledore,you must agree.
13557,Albus Dumbledore,yes.
13558,Albus Dumbledore,you must be the one to kill me severus.
13559,Albus Dumbledore,it is the only way.
13560,Albus Dumbledore,only then will the dark lord trust you completely.
13561,Severus Snape,you ask too much.
13562,Albus Dumbledore,there will come a time when harry potter must be told something.
13563,Albus Dumbledore,but you must wait until voldemort is at his most vulnerable.
13564,Severus Snape,tell him what?
13565,Albus Dumbledore,on the night lord voldemort went to godric's hollow to kill harry and lily potter cast herself between them the curse rebounded.
13566,Albus Dumbledore,when that happened a part of lord voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find: harry himself.
13567,Albus Dumbledore,there's a reason harry can speak with snakes.
13568,Albus Dumbledore,there's a reason he can look into lord voldemort's mind.
13569,Albus Dumbledore,a part of lord voldemort lives inside him.
13570,Severus Snape,so when the time comes the boy must die.
13571,Severus Snape,you've kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment.
13572,Severus Snape,you've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.
13573,Albus Dumbledore,but this is touching severus.
13574,Albus Dumbledore,don't tell me you've grown to care for the boy?
13575,Severus Snape,expecto patronum!
13576,Albus Dumbledore,lily.
13577,Albus Dumbledore,after all this time?
13578,Severus Snape,always... we go to black...
13579,Albus Dumbledore,the irony of course severus is that -- in the end -- you and the boy desire the same thing...
13580,Hermione Granger,where've you been?
13581,Ron Weasley,we thought you'd gone to the forest we thought you might be --
13582,Harry Potter,i'm going there now.
13583,Ron Weasley,are you mad!
13584,Ron Weasley,no!
13585,Harry Potter,it's... meant to be.
13586,Ron Weasley,rubbish!
13587,Ron Weasley,you can't just give yourself up to him -- hermione squeezes ron's arm silencing him.
13588,Hermione Granger,what is it harry?
13589,Hermione Granger,what is it you
13590,Harry Potter,there's a reason i can... hear them -- the horcruxes.
13591,Harry Potter,i think i've known for awhile.
13592,Hermione Granger,i'll go with you.
13593,Hermione Granger,i/'ll --
13594,Harry Potter,kill the snake.
13595,Harry Potter,kill the snake and then it's just him.
13596,Harry Potter,then it will be over.
13597,Oliver Wood,i'll take him from here.
13598,Ginny Weasley,it's all right.
13599,Ginny Weasley,we're going to get you inside.
13600,Student,i kept calling.
13601,Student,no one came.
13602,Ginny Weasley,don't worry.
13603,Ginny Weasley,i won't leave you.
13604,Ginny Weasley,i promise.
13605,Lily Potter,you've been so brave sweetheart.
13606,Harry Potter,why are you here?
13607,Harry Potter,all of you?
13608,Lily Potter,we never left dear.
13609,Harry Potter,does it hurt?
13610,Harry Potter,dying?
13611,Sirius Black,quicker than falling asleep.
13612,Remus Lupin,and he will want it to be quick.
13613,James Potter,you're nearly there son.
13614,Harry Potter,i'm sorry.
13615,Harry Potter,i didn't want any of you to die for me.
13616,Harry Potter,and remus your son...
13617,Remus Lupin,others will tell him what his mother and father died for.
13618,Remus Lupin,someday he'll understand...
13619,Harry Potter,you'll stay with me?
13620,James Potter,until the end.
13621,Harry Potter,he won't be able to see you?
13622,Sirius Black,no.
13623,Sirius Black,we're here you see.
13624,Harry Potter,stay close to me.
13625,Lily Potter,always...
13626,Corban Yaxley,no sign of him my lord.
13627,Voldemort,i thought he would come.
13628,Voldemort,i was it seems... mistaken.
13629,Harry Potter,you weren't.
13630,Corban Yaxley,quiet!
13631,Voldemort,harry potter.
13632,Voldemort,the boy who lived.
13633,Voldemort,come to die.
13634,Voldemort,nagini hisses behind her protective guard of death eaters.
13635,Voldemort,harry's gaze shifts to her when voldemort raises
13636,Albus Dumbledore,you cannot help.
13637,Albus Dumbledore,harry.
13638,Albus Dumbledore,you wonderful boy.
13639,Albus Dumbledore,you brave brave man.
13640,Albus Dumbledore,let us walk.
13641,Harry Potter,sir this is this... i mean forgive me but you are dead aren't you sir?
13642,Albus Dumbledore,oh yes.
13643,Harry Potter,then... i'm dead too?
13644,Harry Potter,not?
13645,Albus Dumbledore,not.
13646,Harry Potter,but i didn't defend myself.
13647,Harry Potter,i let him kill me.
13648,Harry Potter,it's true isn't it sir?
13649,Harry Potter,a bit of him lives in me doesn't it?
13650,Albus Dumbledore,did.
13651,Albus Dumbledore,it was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than voldemort himself.
13652,Albus Dumbledore,you were the seventh horcrux harry; the horcrux he never meant to make.
13653,Harry Potter,and you knew this?
13654,Harry Potter,that's why you were certain i wouldn't die?
13655,Albus Dumbledore,certain?
13656,Albus Dumbledore,no.
13657,Albus Dumbledore,little is certain in this world harry.
13658,Albus Dumbledore,call it an educated guess.
13659,Harry Potter,professor is that -- ?
13660,Harry Potter,exactly where are we sir?
13661,Albus Dumbledore,i was going to ask you that.
13662,Albus Dumbledore,where would you say that we are?
13663,Harry Potter,it looks like king's cross station -- only a lot cleaner.
13664,Harry Potter,and without the trains.
13665,Albus Dumbledore,king's cross!
13666,Albus Dumbledore,is that right?
13667,Albus Dumbledore,well this is as they say your party.
13668,Harry Potter,sir why didn't you just tell me about the deathly hallows?
13669,Albus Dumbledore,you will have to forgive me harry.
13670,Albus Dumbledore,you see... i didn't trust
13671,Albus Dumbledore,i feared that you would make the same mistake i made that you would be intoxicated by the power the hallows promise their possessor.
13672,Albus Dumbledore,but i crave your pardon harry.
13673,Albus Dumbledore,it's clear to me now as it should have been all along that you are the better man.
13674,Harry Potter,sir --
13675,Albus Dumbledore,you are the worthy possessor of the hallows harry not me.
13676,Albus Dumbledore,i was fit to own the elder wand because i took it not for gain but to save others from it.
13677,Albus Dumbledore,but i took the stone because i longed to recall someone who has long been at peace and for that i paid with my life.
13678,Harry Potter,you wanted to see ariana again didn't you sir?
13679,Albus Dumbledore,yes.
13680,Harry Potter,i used the stone as well sir only a little while ago when i entered the forest.
13681,Harry Potter,i saw my mum and dad and sirius and lupin...
13682,Albus Dumbledore,true.
13683,Albus Dumbledore,but ask yourself this: were you calling them?
13684,Albus Dumbledore,or were they calling you?
13685,Harry Potter,i've got to go back haven't i?
13686,Albus Dumbledore,that is up to you.
13687,Harry Potter,i've got a choice?
13688,Albus Dumbledore,oh yes.
13689,Albus Dumbledore,we are in king's cross you say?
13690,Albus Dumbledore,i think should you so decide you would be able to let's say board a train.
13691,Harry Potter,and where would it take me?
13692,Albus Dumbledore,on.
13693,Harry Potter,voldemort's got the elder wand.
13694,Albus Dumbledore,true.
13695,Harry Potter,and the snake lives.
13696,Albus Dumbledore,yes.
13697,Harry Potter,and i've nothing to kill it with.
13698,Albus Dumbledore,'help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it.'
13699,Albus Dumbledore,i have always prized my ability to turn a phrase -- words are in my
13700,Harry Potter,with all due respect sir i think what we need here is a miracle.
13701,Albus Dumbledore,i've never put much stock in miracles harry.
13702,Albus Dumbledore,on the other hand i can attest wholly to the extensive advantages of a related phenomenon.
13703,Harry Potter,which would be sir?
13704,Albus Dumbledore,luck.
13705,Albus Dumbledore,do not pity the dead harry.
13706,Albus Dumbledore,pity the living and above all those who live without love.
13707,Harry Potter,sir my mother's patronus.
13708,Harry Potter,it was a doe wasn't it?
13709,Harry Potter,just like professor snape's.
13710,Harry Potter,curious don't you think?
13711,Albus Dumbledore,actually if i think about it... it doesn't seem curious at all.
13712,Harry Potter,professor.
13713,Harry Potter,is this real?
13714,Harry Potter,or has this been happening inside my head?
13715,Albus Dumbledore,of course it is happening inside your head harry.
13716,Albus Dumbledore,but why should that mean that it is not real?
13717,Bellatrix Lestrange,my lord let me help you --
13718,Voldemort,i do not require assistance.
13719,Bellatrix Lestrange,the boy.
13720,Bellatrix Lestrange,is he dead?
13721,Narcissa Malfoy,is he alive?
13722,Narcissa Malfoy,draco?
13723,Sorting Hat,don't despair longbottom.
13724,Sorting Hat,i put you in gryffindor for good reason...
13725,Ginny Weasley,who's that?
13726,Ginny Weasley,... hagrid's carrying?
13727,Ginny Weasley,neville who is that?
13728,Arthur Weasley,what's going on here neville?
13729,Voldemort,behold nagini.
13730,Voldemort,our work is done.
13731,Ginny Weasley,no... no!
13732,Voldemort,stupid girl.
13733,Voldemort,you cry for that?
13734,Voldemort,while your hands ran dark with the blood of mothers and sons fathers and daughters brothers and sisters his were clasped in prayer -- but it was a prayer for one and one only.
13735,Voldemort,while you battled courageously until you could no longer will yourself to stand he had long since fallen to his knees.
13736,Voldemort,while you cursed me until your voices grew ragged he begged me for mercy in a voice as meek as a child's.
13737,Voldemort,so do not cry for that.
13738,Voldemort,he's not worthy of your tears.
13739,Voldemort,and do not despair of his betrayal.
13740,Voldemort,you were never in his heart.
13741,Voldemort,not for one single solitary beat.
13742,Ron Weasley,liar!
